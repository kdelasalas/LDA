"Philippine telecommunications giant Smart announced on Wednesday, October 28, that Korean superstar Park Seo-joon joined its growing roster of endorsers.
Seo-joon, known for his roles in the series Kill Me, Heal Me, Itaewon Class, and What's Wrong with Secretary Kim, joins fellow Korean actors Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin as the faces of the homegrown telco's campaigns and services.
In a virtual press conference, Smart also announced its partnership with streaming platform Viu, best known for its vast collection of Korean shows. Seo-joon, in particular, stars in a commercial to promote Giga K-Video, a package that allows subscribers access to Korean shows via Viu.
""Like the two other international endorsers, PSJ is popular and well loved by the Filipino audience,"" explained Smart president Al Panlilio, who described their Korean brand endorsers as ""very professional, humble, and very successful in their careers.""
Smart executives said initial talks for the partnership with Viu began in January, with more serious talks of potentially tapping Seo-joon in June 2020. His contract with Smart was signed in August 2020, with the shoot for the TVC and campaign happening over two days in September.
Just like Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin's, Park Seo-joon's contract includes a visit to the Philippines – the date of which has yet to be determined, owing to pandemic restrictions.
In a pre-taped video during a Smart press conference, the actor said the Hallyu craze – or the rise in popularity of Korean shows and talents – fascinated him, particularly because of the differences in language. In the end, the actor had fans to thank for the popularity of Korean content in countries like the Philippines.
The TVC is only the first of 3 Smart campaigns that will star Seo-joon.
GIGA K-Video 99 is open for Smart Prepaid and TNT users, and comes with a 7-day Viu Premium subscription, 1 GB of data for Viu every day for 7 days, plus 2 GB of open access data. Subscribers can register for GIGA K-Video by dialing *123# and will soon be available via the GigaLife App – Rappler.com"
"K-drama fans, hold on to your hearts because we’ve got some big news coming your way! Two days after teasing their newest ambassador, Smart Communications finally confirmed Korean heartthrob Park Seo Joon as their latest official endorser!
The Itaewon Class actor joins the Smart family fresh off the heels of his fellow Hallyu stars Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin who both inked a one-year contract with the telecommunications company a few months ago.
In a media preview this afternoon, Smart revealed that Seo Joon will be championing their Giga K-Video intiative in partnership with Asian streaming platform Viu, and in line with the telecom's K-Life series.
In a TVC shown to the press, a handsome, suit-clad Seo Joon can be seen consoling a young woman who just went through a tough breakup with the words ""'K lang yan."" And yes, we all swooned when he spoke near-perfect Filipino. He then goes to cheer her up with unlimited K-drama viewing via Smart and Viu's new offering. “Basta may Smart Giga, K-video every day,” he says at the end with a charming smile and a swoon-worthy wink.
In case you were wondering, yes, much like Hyun Bin and Ye Jin, Seo Joon is also contracted to visit the country once the current pandemic eases up. When asked about his reaction to the immense love he's been receiving from Filipino fans, Seo Joon responded, “It was surprising because I don’t take on a project expecting love and popularity. I’m also fascinated by how different our languages are…It still doesn’t feel real. It’s also amusing but I’m also grateful.”
Fun fact: Seo Joon is well aware of Smart's ongoing partnership with Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin. According to Smart executives present during the media event, he's proud and happy to be part of their line-up of Korean endorsers. His one request? For the commercials to play up his fun and romantic persona, as opposed to the corporate looks of the brand's past TVCs. So cute!
Smart's Giga K-Video 99 gives customers a premium subscription to Viu, complete with no ads, unlimited skips, access to the latest K-dramas, and 1gb of Viu and YouTube every day for seven days.

"It’s confirmed—Park Seo-jun is the latest endorser of Smart Communications!
The telecommunications company confirmed on Wednesday that the South Korean actor is their newest brand ambassador, following previous endorsers Hyun Bin and Son Hye-jin.
Before the announcement, Smart shared teasers on its social media accounts, showing glimpses of the actor going down a spiral staircase, getting out of a car, and smiling.
Park Seo-jun is one of South Korea’s leading drama actors. He is famous for his roles in the K-dramas “Itaewon Class,” “What’s Wrong With Secretary Kim?”, “Fight For My Way,” “Hwarang,” and “She Was Pretty,” among many other TV and film projects. – GMA News"
"Mobile services provider Smart Communications, Inc. has partnered with Viu, a leading pan-regional streaming service operated by Viu International Limited, to launch the new GIGA K-Video data pack with Korean superstar Park Seo Jun as endorser.
Smart GIGA K-Video is the first-ever prepaid data pack in the Smart Giga family that comes with a Viu Premium subscription, making it so much simpler and easier for Filipinos to enjoy the latest Korean content with unlimited downloads and an uninterrupted, no-ads experience.
Bringing the Better K-Life to Filipinos

We know that Viu has played a pivotal role in bringing the best of Korean entertainment to the country, so through this partnership, we aim to make it simpler and easier for our subscribers to immerse in their love for K-Life with the latest content on Viu.”

‘K-Lang Yan’ with Park Seo Jun
Right on the mark, Smart has signed up Korean superstar Park Seo Jun to launch GIGA K-Video in a multimedia campaign. The award-winning actor joins Smart’s growing roster of Korean celebrity endorsers, reinforcing Smart’s thrust to bring Filipinos closer to their passions.
In his TV commercial, Park Seo Jun says “K-Lang Yan”, a wordplay suggesting things will be fine and that Korean shows bring delight to viewers by enabling them to immerse in an alternative reality.
Park Seo Jun said, “Filipinos and Koreans uphold common values especially when it comes to love for family and friends, and I think this is one of the reasons K-dramas resonate well with many Filipino viewers. I am thankful for this opportunity to encourage more Filipinos to discover and enjoy more Korean content and to take a breather from these uncertain times.”
Ms. Basas rationalized, “Anyone who has watched a Korean drama or variety show can attest to their special magic. Of course, this includes Park Seo Jun’s hit K-dramas like She Was Pretty and What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim which make him the perfect endorser for this campaign.”
Park Seo Jun’s shows are frequently top titles on Viu Philippines.
Available to all Smart Prepaid and TNT customers, GIGA K-Video 99 data pack comes with a 7-day Viu Premium subscription, 1 GB of data for Viu every day for 7 days, plus 2 GB of open access data.

"MANILA – Following Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin, Smart Communications on Wednesday introduced South Korean actor Park Seo Joon as its latest international endorser.
The 31-year old actor, known for recently starring in the series ""Itaewon Class,"" was unveiled as the new face of Smart K-Life with an ad showing him opposite an actress from Myanmar.
In a virtual press conference, executives of the telecommunications company shared what Park’s reaction was when he was tapped to become one of its endorsers.
“He was very happy and very proud of the fact that he will be joining the Smart family alongside Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin. He was aware of the campaigns that we did with the first two Korean celebrities. He’s also very aware of the huge fan base he has in the Philippines,” said Jane Basas, Smart SVP and head for Consumer Wireless Business.
Basas said the only request of Park’s team was to make his campaign different and unique from those of Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin.
“We made sure to play up his fun side, we made sure to play up his romantic persona to make it stand out versus the two original campaigns which were quite corporate in the treatment. I think he’ll be very happy with this one,” she said.
Basas said Park will be starring in two campaigns and Smart will be releasing his second commercial in the next few weeks.
When asked if they will bring Park to the Philippines in the future, Smart president and CEO Alfred Panlilo said: “Of course we plan to bring them in. Per contract, they would all come in. PSJ is also coming in. It’s really just the timing. Today, we cannot commit yet on the timing because of the travel restrictions but we will try our very best to make it happen. It will come.”
The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted countries to impose travel restrictions and prohibit mass gatherings, leading also to the cancellation and postponement of concerts and fan meets by ""Korean wave"" artists in the Philippines.
Park first visited the Philippines in September 2019. At that time, he held a fan meet at the Mall of Asia Arena after he was picked as a celebrity endorser for homegrown clothing brand Bench.
Aside from ""Itaewon Class,"" Park is notable for starring in the dramas ""She Was Pretty,"" ""Hwarang,"" ""Fight For My Way,"" and ""What's Wrong with Secretary Kim."""
