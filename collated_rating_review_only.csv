2,"The app loads slowly compared to Gcash Paymaya, etc. There is a bug in the code, STRING cannot be found."
3,the apps work in my asus phone but the touch is slow to response. also the data status didnt say if this is total consumed or balance available

4,"this app is great good job smart app dev. i hope you can have a farm of smart prepaid numbers, the process now is you to key in the otp once you put in another smart number. i mean you'll just have 1 main number and the rest of the prepaid can be monitored without re-encoding the 4 digit numbers. overall you'll get a big 5 if this happen. :) keep it up"
3,I find it cumbersome that I need to check my expiration dates and data balance through *123# after initially downloading the app. I hope the update fixed this. I may guve it a higher rating afterwards.
5,
5,
5,I try this
5,Simple and pass Registered and buy a load
2,"I am a smartload retailer, masyado paring mahal ang load ni smart while globe can give us 5GB open access for only 50 pesos and 8GB open access for 90 pesos."
1,Takes too long to load. My internet is fine. everything loads fast except this app.
4,its easy to use but im hoping that sooner it also gave its customers points to redeem everytime we do top up on network. for now 4 stars not bad

5,
3,"I hope the app can store several numbers, instead of checking one by one or needing a OTP. The old Smart app has that feature where the numbers are already stored there. I use the old Smart app to monitor the load balance of all my family members, so I can reload their phone numbers when they are running out of load. I suggest you bring back this feature."

1,They have a promo from July 31-Aug 2 it says if you register through the app you will get double the promo. Well i tried it earlier i was pressing the buy gigavideo button and the app freezes. This is the only app that freezes in my phone. Why does your 8mb app freeze on a 3gb ram phone? 1/5

1,"Got scammed, if there's a new version i won't be able to use the app, not so convenient. They call it ""free stories"" and ""free videos"" even tho we deserved more than that. They once offer extra 2GB of data, but your youtube data will not be eaten first instead your youtube browsing will be deduced from the extra 2GB on top of your regular promo subscription, making it nonsense, since the youtube data refreshed every midnight."
1,I think it was a non sense app . I didn't saw what you are talking about !
5,Ok

5,Useful App
5,Pretty amazing!
5,"I like this app, well there's a little bug on some cases, but you know i used to it, i really like the service of smart, good for gaming when on high signal, and not bad for downloading big files, lowest ping i can get in mobile legends is 18, while globe is at 40, you guys meet my expectation because my expectation is not that high, i hope it can get better before 2021, i love it even sometimes it's really slow."

5,
5,
4,"okay na, yung bilis nalang problema ko, pero salamat"

4,"The update fixed most of the old bugs but i can still be better. A suggestion for the promos like GigaVideo, GigaStories, GigaGames, instead of giving _ amount of data and 1gb free for select apps during the validity of the promo, It would be more beneficial for the users to have _ amount of data and have that free 1gb as a whole. For example GigaVideo 599 5gb open access+ 1gb free for 30 days, it would be better if the free 1gb would be 30gbs valid for 30 days especially during these times."

1,i didn't get the promo about double your giga. i subcribe on giga 50 but the apps said i didnt subcribe any...
5,
4,"I like that it's very lightweight app so it has great performance. App is very simple/easy to use. However, it's only 4 stars because I don't like that it requires you to place your Smart sim to slot 1 of the phone and to use the data of that sim."
2,I give a two star because after few days of using it you cannot continue launch the app and you need to update it for you be able to launch again. After few days again the same thing will happen I get tired on updating this app for me ba eble to use this app. I hope the smart can fix this kind of problem ...

3,Mobile number needs to be entered several times even if they say it's for one time only offering us with an OTP. So irritatingly inputting number for couple of times just to check the remaining balances for all the registered promos I had. I even ended up dialing *143# again to make my transaction.

5,This app is great everything is good and also i can manage my data consumption too!
1,This is the worst app ever rather focusing on app just make your data for 99 to 10gb data then you can make your people happy. Globe is doing it why can't you?

1,ISA KAYONG MALAKING PUTANGINA. MAS LALO NYO LANG PINAHIHIRAPAN ANG CUSTOMERS NYO. UNA TINANGGAL NYO YUNG REGISTRATION NG PROMOS VIA TEXT KUNG SAAN MAS MADALI YUN PARA SA AMIN LALO NA'T SA WIFI NAKA INSERT ANG AMING SIM. PANGALAWA GUSTO NYO MAG INSTALL KAMI NG SMART APP NYONG BULOK PARA MAKAPAG REGISTER KASI WALA NAMANG DIALER ANG WIFI PERO HINDI NAMAN MAKAPAG REGISTER DAHIL WALA YUNG PART KUNG SAAN PWEDE MAG REGISTER.

I've been having this problem since Famload was removed but I tried everything I can and everything the internet suggested but it's still not working. I need it badly for work and Smart/PLDT is making it very hard for us.

5,Nice
2,This app is just focusing on their GIGA subscriptions you can't even check your other data plans like famload or surfmax it says no active promos. So most probably if you're not fan or not using GIGA promos you should not use the app instead.

1,app sucks
1,Tang ina niyo smart aanhin ko ng app niyo kung mabagal naman yung internet niyo. Tang ina niyo pag gumanda na serbisyo niyo baka gawin ko tong 5 star. Sa bagay magsasara naman na kayo sa December pag hindi niyo pa inayos yung internet niyo mga hinayupak.

They said 2gb araw2x in 7days but with in 4days ubos lahat ang data ko. Why smart??? At isa pa games lang gamit ko at sometimes videos in total of 900mb all lang nagamit everyday.

5,Ehems
5,It is so helpful for me
3,Omu ok na ng kunti ..
1,If youre going to develop an app make sure it will be useful to your subscribers. New number should register and not ask for OTP again when that number already verified. Quite annoying and hassle for me.
5,
2,The app is fine actually. But asking for the number over and over again is quite annoying specially when we can't remember it. Hopefully you can read the sim number if it find her the requirement like the sim should be in sim 1 Dan - it is actually in sim 1
5,Nice. App.

3,"App is broken, Wont let me renew my subscription. The only thing this app can be used for is to view your balance or recharge. Also have unnecessary functions like it keeps asking me for my number everytime I open the app and keeps asking me for a code which gets annoying. I dont know what the other's experiences are but so far for me the app is useless and a waste of space."

Edited. From 2 stars to 4stars. We still need to turn on data for auto number detection, but if we will be using it to register to a promo per se, then turning mobile data before it will consume regular load."

5,Fast and easy to find promos
2,Very disappointed with the recent promos! Dapat may option din kayo sa app to choose kung anong app ang kasama sa freebies. Tulad ko na Facebook at YouTube iyong frequently used apps ko kaya iyong Giga promo subscription ko isang araw o two days lang ubos na. Consider this suggestion please!

5,Very useful app and user friendly. I hope that watching youtube will be added to giga work plan.
1,"Magpalabas na kayo ng bagong promo. Yung open data kagaya ng globe. Yung customer nyo bumili na ng globe sim, doon may 5Gb na open data ang 50 pesos mo. Aanhin namin ang mabilis na connection ng smart kung yung 1Gb na open data ubos na agad. Hindi naman connectivity ang problema, mas mabilis pa nga ang smart dito samin. The problem is your data promo ( based on 50 pesos) cost more per Gb than your competitor's newly released promo's (10 pesos per Gb)."
5,
5,
1,Why don't you have an option to purchase additional data for free web browsing?

COVID days ngayon, asan puso nyo para sa mga tao? 👎👎👎 Anyone reading this, choose Globe instead. Anlaki ng matitipid nyo. Hndi tulad ng Smart na napaka-smart!"

1,I have a smart prepaid number and a smart bro prepaid. Everytime that i want to check my data/balance i have to key in the mobile number and the otp. This is quite annoying especially for the smartbro since its on the router and i have to log in on the router's dashboard to get the otp. The PLDT smart app is way better coz you can see all your enrolled numbers. Can you just update the pldtsmart app instead?
5,I love it
2,Why can't I buy load using my debit card??? I've been trying so many times already.. Please help
5,
5,How to acces?
5,
5,Exelent
1,The app deducted from my Paymaya account but did not reflect on the Smart App dashboard. How do you resolve this? Update 3 days later: Still no result. I highly discourage downloading this app. It does not provide the services it promised.
5,I love it
5,Try it
2,"Smart, you have to improve your prepaid offers. With Globe, for 90 only a subscriber will have 8gb data and allnet texts for 1 week! For 50, a subscriber will have 5gb data and allnet texts for 3 days. And, why do we have to enter the smart number on this app! Has it been updated yet to automatically show the smart number we're using? I hope Duterte's threat to shut you and Globe down will push you to update your services.PH has the slowest internet speed in Asia yet we pay a lot and get less."
3,can you add a check balance or mb so that we can see how much is left in our data subscription thank you.
1,"I uninstalled the app coz it just says error on the screen and cannot use the phone coz the app keeps restarting on its own and crashes and restarts again,restarted it over and over but the problem persist, it looks like this app has a bug of sorts that makes it utterly useless."

3,"I liked it at first because it's been giving me nice promos. However I have now been experiencing technical difficulties in this app. I have a problem regarding my connection with the App. It keeps on requesting for my number and when I submit the OTP given, it's still not working. I've repeatedly done it several times yet I still can't access the app. I also tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, yet it still doesn't work. My sim is also placed on the SIM1 of my phone, yet it still doesn't seem to resolve the problem. I need your help regarding this please. Thank you."

1,"I used to like this app because of its efficiency but after a month of use, I cannot open it and kept on saying ""Something went wrong, please try again"" and sends OTP on the mobile number I registered, I followed the steps given but still cannot open the app. I am going to uninstall this and go back to usual taking out of my sim from my modem and insert it on a phone to register. What a waste of time! Please improve this SMART! Or better design a new app which can register to GIGA promos."

1,"The app can't open if there's no data. How can I register the promo if that's the situation, too useless."
1,"Yes, got in after waiting for over 2 minutes for the code to be sent to the cell no. Then, after i am in the options page, as soon as i press on something, sends me BACK TO the sing in code page, as if to say i have skipped the whole thing...but this is where the 'fun' begins;-( When prompted on that window to get another code, and (eventually) getting it, then it says is not 'valid'..tried over 5 times...nothing...

1,"1st of, sorry giving this rating a star, I just want to be noticed by the app's developers. I would immidiately rate this app a lot more higher if the developers add all promos available when one dials *121#. Because it's a little inconvenient that some promos are not in the app which the main purpose of this app is to make Smart Communications users register to promos with ease. Thank you for your time and I hope the developers see the comment for a better and easy to use app."
1,"It's good using for check balance and status but not for registering to a promo. I tried to reinstall the app as suggested, at the first it work but after few logins it not show."

1,"What the hell are you doing smart, its just being dumb. Whats the need of having otp pin when wanting to top up a prepaid number. The best thing you can do once app launched is to display balance on existing balance on the phone number where you app installed then give all available calling, txting, surfing, combo plans. Hindi yung putang inang otp na napakatagal dumating. Ontop of that it does not even display the phone number where the app is istalled IT SUCKS TO THE MAX."

1,"Always asking for an OTP every time I need to log in. Isn't it supposed to be a ""one time"" verification? Fix it."

3,"I liked the app before, but after several fake promo texts to my cellphone, I got pretty pissed. It doesn't really affect my phone in anyway except when there's promos. And the promos I recieved were fake. So what else can this app do? Nothing. I can do everything else directly on my phone. So, sorry? But uninstall."

5,Very satisfied
3,"I installed to avail of the promos. I like the interface. But since I will never put my Smart sim in my sim tray 1 due to poor signal here in our area, I always have to enter my number everytime I log in. It's also a pity I cannot manage 2 numbers at once like how I do with the old MySmart App. I guess I'll keep using that until they decommission it."
5,Excellent

Exclusively via Smart App. Nag subscribe ako using this Smart app ng GIGA video 100, hindi nman nadoble! Ano toh Smart? Scam ba ito? I received the the additional GB promo an hour after I post my original comment. Smart, you should inform or include to your promo ads that IT MAY TAKE WITHIN 24 HOURS to receive the data rewards. Thanks you."

I'll give you 5s if u fix it. Regards. Update: i will not be able to put it on my phone since I only have sim slot #1 for my main #.

3,"I found some flaws on your UX. Promo selection not showing on the quick view screen (NO PLANS TO SELECT AT ALL), infinite loading/refreshing time, app hanging when viewing recent transactions, taking forever to check your number unless you restart the app. Did all the troubleshooting recommended by CX support but nothing changed. UX is very faulty on my phone, only use there is checking data and balance, but app works fine in Android x86 (which is surprising)."

3,It's great that I can still reload my sim card using the app even without an outstanding data subscription or internet connection. Altho I find it frustrating that I can't sbuscribe thru the app because it becomes unresponsive whenever I try to. What's the point of promoting double data during the weekend by subscribing thru the app if you can't even do that? This app is obviously unpolished. You're better off investing to improving it first than making promos people can't even avail.

I confirm payment by logging to ny bank account. My bank answers oayment is granted, go back to the seller, which is Smart. The Smart oage says Sorry payment was not successful.I just mention that payment using the same bank acoount wirks with the old smart app. I reported the error by phone to Smart, but no change."

5,You made some new things. But I would suggest you put some Live/Active Tracker for Data Consumption in the system of the app. That would be better for all consumer to keep track of their Mobile Data usage.

4,"I like the app it helps me monitor my data usage but in the recent days,the Free promos doesn't indicate on how much data left,only the shareable Mobile data"
5,
1,Still useless. Offers are very expensive. You get 24gb at the price or 999 for a month which in globe app special offers at minimum 8gb a week for 90php if for a month you would only pay 360php for 30 days. If you want 10gb a week its only 120 for a month will only go for 480php. The offers are super duper far. You get more than the data but a lesser price to pay. So better improve your price and offers.
1,
3,"This past few weeks I've been using this app ,and it's good but I've been experiencing some difficulties due to unstable data connection especially on some promos I've subcribe with allocated data ,which is Facebook,insta and Twitter yet in tiktok it's fast but on some apps allocated along with it it's not..I don't know if due to unstable data or if they're been limiting usage on Facebook ?!!"
5,
5,
5,
1,It's not useful at all. Those promos are not even enough for their expensive cost because the internet is slow. The app even stopped working and I can't access it to know how much data I used. I'm very disappointed.

3,Hmm... Okay I take back all I've said. There's still a lot of thing to improve on though.

1,Trash network means trash promos and trash data connection. I registered for Giga 99 VIDEOS in *121# and it says that GIGA 99 have also additional 1gb of data allocation everyday for Youtube and google play in a SUPRIZES promo but 2 days now the additional 1gb everyday is not been added. Such a crappp!! I think that promo is expired but TNT and SMART not removed in *121# to register other people but the promo is expired. SUCH A WASTE AND NEEDED TO REPORT TO DTI.
1,My NEW PREPAID SMART Bro SIM PRE-INSTALLED in MY PLDT HOME WIFI does not allow me to reload. SMART msg says it is invalid. This SMART App is only useful for REGULAR SMART & TM SIM INSTALLED ON PHONE. SMART is NOT SMART. GLOBE App works for All SIMS either Installed on Phone or in GLOBE HOME WIFI. I am forced to use GLOBE HOME PREAID WIFI because it use User Friendly. I hope SMART does not ignore this.

2,Does not remember your login. You have to type in your phone number and be authenticated every time. A basic fundamental flaw. Once you have done all that every time it works okay which is why I've given it two stars.

5,
1,"It's useless. It doesn't update balances when you input your number. I find it a hassle to key in the OTP everytine you want to check you balance. Hello, most phones are dual SIM na. I'd rather use *123# now. What's the use of having an APP like this?! For a big company its disappointing!"

I never had the chance to use the data and was unable to connect at all. I already activated my account and yet don't know why there's no signal everywhere I go. It is very disappointing .

1,I want to use this app to subscribe to your offers but the menu is nowhere to be found. Do you guys test your own apps before deploying? Whats more frustrating is the picture of the girl thats occupying almost half the space. Shee seems to be laughing or mocking at you for your misery in trying to find the menu to choose to subscribe to the available offers. Gusto na ngang basagin tong phone ko dahil dito.

Hopefully, Smart can come up with a faster way of checking our data usage, lime creating widgets that can be placed in iur homescreen. In that way, we won't have to open the app just to view my data use and data balance. Thank you so much, SMART! 💚❤️"

4,I want all the promos in *123# when you dialed will be shown here. Not all usage of data for 1gb of free video are shown. Can you make an update for this.
1,Walang pasaload pahirapan pa nag loloko pa sa manual parang gago.. paalisin na sana kayo ni duterte mga walang silbe
2,"Data promos in the lower side are sometimes not appearing, how could I choose the GIGA Pro promos that this app is advertised if its not there when I need it."
2,This app is a sham. Doesn't do anything other than load balance and current registered promo. It doesn't even show TNT promos.
5,It's really good to use data on my phone
1,"even the app doesn't compensate for the kind of service from this greedy company, poorly made, changes app every year or two, bugs, etc, will try another telco if one pops up, anything not affiliated with globe smart pldt"

5,Nice apps and very easy to use
5,Amazing and more options!
5,
4,"Despite forgoing the OTP apart from the initial registration, the app still asked me to login again after closing the app and opening it again. It could be improved in that department. Another suggestion, you might want to include in Giga Study promo data allocation for videoconferencing apart from Microsoft Teams like Zoom and Google Meet. Students do videoconferencing too because of online classes. Lastly, it would be nice if you could add a Feedback section in-app."
5,Excellent

5,
4,"It was really great kasi mas napapadali magregister lalo na if naka prepaid wifi kaaa. Kasoo, wala yung ibang promos sa app like gametime100 ganon. Pero, overall ay okay naman"

5,"I just updated my smart app, i was shocked the app name's changed into gigalife, after updating, i opened it but it wasnt responding."
5,
5,Convenient This app gives a preview of a promo before registering to a certain promo. It also detects the number you are using.
2,The app is not working the last update sucks :(
1,Not responding

4,
1,THE NEW UPDATE ISN'T WORKING. IM DISAPPOINTED .
3,"I also have a problem on my smart app, it registered unli trinet calls and allnet txt, then i have 1,000 pesos balance load but when i started outgoing call it consume my regular not my registered promo. When my regular load are consumed successfully it say i cant make a call cause i am not registered to any promos. I wasted arround 1,000 pesos for not using my registered promos even you are registered. I never complain anymore because i don't know how to contact the costumer service to refund."
1,The Latest App (GigaLife)cannot be used since it's force closing or freezes when being opened. The previous version is better.
5,
5,This is is very great when it comes to monitoring my data usage!!! Very thankful for this.
3,"This app is great for checking and applying for your favorite data package, and for getting data regarding your subscriptions. The only downside is you have to input your smart number and wait for an OTP everytime you're going to login in the app which takes a lot of time and is a hassle, why not instead use a biometric login or pin so as to simplify the mode of logging into your app. You better keep up with your competitor."
5,
5,
5,
5,"I really like the updates from Smart App to GigaLife. Smart/TNT mobile app developers and product management are great! The UX of GigaLife compared to the beta version are almost same but more improved. I like the new feature allowing us to link our account, would be nicer for us to be able to pick the accounts from our contacts (hard to copy and paste mobile number, or memorizing them). About security, the ability of the app to detect mobile# in the same network is a security issue."
3,"all in all there is nothing wrong with the app... it does what it is supposed to do, that is to make it easy for subscribers to avail the promos they want. But the only problem really is your network signal. from time to time everday I'm experiencing very low internet speed from your network, wether it be download or upload. Imagine it shows on a speed checker app i am using a download speed of 0.03mbps and upload speed of 0.2mpbs although the ping is at 80-90ms."
5,This app is really good and too easy to use
5,
1,The latest update is bad it crashes

1,"App is buggy! Everytime you go back to previous page/tab, screem turns black and you have to relaunch the app. But when you relaunch the app, you have to log-in again.

If i didnt read the text from tnt then i would never know. Some promos are also not available in the app. Like there are promos when dialing *123# that are not in the app. So like, why download the app when u can just dial it lmao. Also, it's like asking for updates every week/every two weeks🙄& the app is still completely the same, just different design👎."

1,"The new update of your app does not make sense. The old version was much better than this. When I open the app I cant click the button to check my remaining balance, after that it close by itself. Also the internet is such a trash, it has many promos but their network and signal was too slow, like a turtle. Its 2020 but the Philippine network like Smart and Globe didnt grow, it should be also closed just like what Pres. Duterte did to ABS CBN. I should not put a star. TRASH!"

1,I like the new design of the app but still this app should include SUN CELLULAR Numbers and Accounts also.
4,"9/20 Thank you for Listening about implementing a Password! Would Give 5 Stars once there are more Online Payment Mode Available such as PayPal or Gpay. Another Note is even there is a Password implementation, I hate how it logs me out everytime I kill/close the app. OLD REVIEW: Should use Gpay when paying. I want to pay via other methods and not with just my Debit/Credit Card. Also, why not implement a pin/password instead of sending OTP each time."

1,"The beta version is better, the new one is not giving me the best experience that every customer should have. I just want to monitor my usage with the app but I think I will go to the old technique using the *123# call... And maybe because the beta version is much simplier and smoother rather than many designs."

I'm using smart lte sim, my Internet is faster than prepaid wifi (bakit ganun hahaha) so I suggest adding data (e.g. Gigapro199 = 6 gb, gawin nyo na 12 gb.

5,Very usefull app
5,
2,
4,"App was great before the update. This current update makes the app crash. Haven't been able to use it ever since the update. Just keeps crashing. Edit: It got fixed now as per devs instruction to uninstall then reinstall. I just find it weird that it seems like you have to download a base app then download the update afterwards. Anyway, this app is pretty useful and easy to use. It also has all the information I need to track my data usage and remaining balance."
4,
5,
5,"(It keep closing after i log in and going back to log in or quick view.can't even register to a promo.) Now its fix i give you 5 for immediate action,mas okay na inavigate yung apps at mas madali makita yuung data usage and kaylan maeexpire yung load at higit sa lahat mas mabilis mag register in just a tap."
5,
5,
5,
1,So slow and always asking me to log in. Zero star fits for this apps.
3,
1,After the forced update the app can't be used properly anymore if i could give no star then i would i can't click on anything for Pete's sake i can't use this anymore
5,
3,still looking forward on the cheapest deal that you have. So far so good for inquiring the balance.
5,"You finally fix the lagging and force close issue in your last update yesterday, thank you!"
5,
5,"Since the new update, i can't now use the app, it just crashes, well i don't even surprise with Philippine telco mobile application, its totally worthless I used to have a very convenient use of older version when mandatory update came up, and it failed me again! Edit: it finally fixed, thanks!"

3,Thanks for the new update. I hope it will be the way it is before. Now I can use it.
1,Compulsory updates waste data. This happens when you hire dumb developers.
1,puro update ehh..
3,"It's a good app, easy registration and easy check data balance. Only problem is the force update every time update is available which makes the app unusable until you updated the app. It would be much better if you allow us to choose to update or not, because there are times that we/i just want to check load balance but i cant because it needs an update."
5,"Can I suggest a ""FREE STUDIES FOR ALL"" promo for us students? thank you smart"
5,Nice app
5,Very nice app

1,bulok mga promo pera pera lang talaga ang smart 😠😠😠 tiis lang muna tayo sa bulok na mga promo nila
3,Slow start up
5,
5,
3,"It's okay but I hate how we need to update it constantly and can't use it unless we update it like what if we don't have internet access cause we're not registered to a promo, then we can't update it?"
3,I can't open the app since i updated it!

1,
5,
5,
5,Good apps
4,"The updated version is better. The promos can be easily seen and it loads faster, no hassle. The only flaw I observed is that I have to log in every single time I open the app. Do I need to have a data load just to do that or it'll work even I don't have load????"

It's just that, I really wish you would assign a more generic app cover/wallpaper rather than having it with photos of models flashing teeth and with b*#bs about to pop out; these are just too personalized that do not even suit the taste of your many loyal but reserved or less flashy subscribers like me.. Thanks for your kind attention to this review."
5,This app is easy to use.it save time for me.l like it.

Ever since I've been using GIGA VIdeo for my Gaming (BLIZZARD World of Warcraft) via tether and I've got no problem with the connection and all sorts, in-fact connection is better and in low latency than being on Wi-Fi. But now using the new app and the new plans,i cannot connect to the game servers to play the game and even access the game website. Can you check on this please."

I'm willing to switch if you're slowest internet connection will continue. Aside from that, please fix your Customer Service because no one answered or replied to my messages. I'm looking forward for your Fast Internet but for now it's far away from the reality."

Thanks anyway for the 1 year+ of service"

4,It's good easy to use it has the usage and all but it's missing some components and easily misunderstood i like how the shareable has it's own measuring section but the promo is hard to understand for instance it said i got 4 gb and i was using it later i run out of data but it's still said 4 gb what does it mean ? Is it gonna be the data that we gonna get after reset or the data that we are currently using it doesn't say anything except exp date make the promo a measuring section like shareable

2,"Convenient only when the app actually opens up. I get a black screen and the app stops responding too many times. It keeps logging you back out too. At this rate, I would rather use the good old *143#."
4,Conveniently reminds or suggests me of promos I could really use.
1,Anong nangyari bakit nasira na yung apps? Ayaw na gumana sa phone ko. Paki tangal ang update nyo😒
4,"Works perfectly again. Thanks for the update. Can you add additional data tho? Ngl Globe promos are way much better... Its just theres no globe signal here, that's why i have no choice but to use smart sim😅"

5,

4,
5,
1,
5,
5,
5,
1,Getting even worst. OTP is not being sent out. Sa ibang network walang ganitong hassle ang app nila also may option for login using fingerprint. Plus ang ibang network nagoofer na ng 8 gig for 90 pesos kayo stuck up padin sa 2 gig @ 99 pesos. You may be the biggest but you are not the greatest.
5,
3,
5,Please continue on giving an extra GB when using this app. It is really a big help.
3,"Hi, I have a question about one of your promos on smart (Giga stories). Why is that whenever i view videos on tiktok or FB stories. The data being consumed is from my shareable date and not the data from my 2GB stories i recieved everyday. Its like the free 2GB data i recieved daily is not worth it because my shareable data is consumed every time i play videos on tiktok and FB stories. I hope you can work on this issue of mine. Thank you"

1,"Its actually great and useful but i certainly hope the next time you releases an update make sure that it wont cause the app to lag or crash since the previoua version was way better and easier to use but now, right after the update werent able to use it properly and just now uninstalled it. And please dont make it a requirement for everyone to install the new version since not everyone are connected to wifi and have huge data accumulation that can update and uninstall then reinstall it again."

1,Tang ina nyo puro update
5,
2,why are we forced to update almost every day
1,everyday update 😵😵
1,update always appear...not recommended
1,"Man I just want to check my balance. You keep on forcing these updates, now look at your rating. This is really frustrating. If I could give 0 I would"
2,Why this app always updating ?
5,
5,
4,the update is much better than the previous version but the update happens too often which I think annoying considering that the developer only wants to optimize the app. thank you.
3,Its a good app. Easy to use and you can view your balance and your data even if using a pocket wifi.. But i like the previews app than this.. Its always asking for an update almost everyday.. Plus i have to register my number just to use this app not like the previous one which is automatic. Its kinda hassle.
2,Always needed to update
2,it always force update every other day!!
1,The new update killed my experience because it freezes whenever I try to renew promo. Please fix this.
1,This update is not usable
1,The application is always updating remember this is not online game or any MMORPG apps is just only a guidline
1,Its good

5,♥️♥️
5,
2,Please include Zoom with your Giga Study Pro and Netflix with your Giga Video!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,The force update is annoying. I just want to check my remaining data balance 🥴
3,Inconvenience you always need to update the app before you can use it. Please stop this time to time update or make an option which users can update now or later. Other than the regular update issue this app works fine and useful to check balance in easy way.
5,Amazing
4,
1,New update more crash.
5,Its so nice to use
4,
1,
5,I love it

2,New feature where the app is forcing you to update whenever there's a new update? Nah. 2 star for that. Since there's new massive feature / design theres always going to be a bug and ofc you guys will quickly patch such bug. so are you going to keep on bugging us with the force update everytime you make such patch? Edit: ugh just updated yesterday now im updating today again.
5,
5,
5,
5,
1,This app updates every other day. I just updated last Saturday and it needs a new update today. Does smart make money eating our MB. We should at the very least have the option not to upgrade and use the older version. Very disappointing specially when your app is very useful.

4,"Best app by smart. Easy to register on promos. But with new update and you can login, it would be nice if fingerprint scanner can work so I don't always have to type my login. The said instructions are not available despite updated the giga app and using Samsung Android 10."
5,
1,
1,please give us a good connection ! how we can enjoy your giga if we always experience lost connection
3,"Thanks Smart for doing updates in this app, i have still some concern. Regarding checking remaining balance, it not showing my remaining daily game data.. Im currently subscribed to Gigagames 2. Looking forward regarding this problem.. Tha ks."
5,
4,Smart i know that you're in trouble now but please please please make your service better because seriously need your strong internet signal for my online study. I just experienced your weak signal this past few weeks and your app always ask me to update. I hope you'll make your service better. Have a good day.

5,
3,"I find it better before the update. I don't like how the colors and designs changed (personal preference because I prefer the minimalist one). Also, the app crashes time to time. Whenever I try to check my usage (after few hours of not opening the app), what would greet me is pitch black. I have to turn close the app and when I open it, I have to type my number all over again and wait for the code. It's kinda annoying."

2,"I thought otp is gone? Why does it still ask me for otp whenever I add a number? and I want to add a smart bro number inserted in a router, how would I get the otp then??? Lastly, please allow users to delete/deactivate their accts. I made a new account and would like to delete the first one I made using a different number."

5,Your new update sucks. The app hangs up after logging in. Can't click anything. Stuck at the first page. I regret updating the app. Fix it. Edit: It's fix. I'm so happy. The app's very useful and easy to use. My violent reaction is an effect of the 1st update turning the app into GigaLife. 😁😁😁

1,
5,Very Good
1,
1,Update again nakakaubos kayo ng data
1,"I like the older version before the update... It is not working anymore... It takes a lot of space in the internal storage just by updating/installing it... A lot of users have phones with lower internal storage... This is only good for rich people or users with expensive phones... I'll just dial *123# from now and then, it's easier..."
5,

5,Its great
5,
3,
5,
5,This app is way more easier to use rather than the traditional method of registering a promo. I've used this for a year to check my data usage and to subcribe to a promo and I can tell that I haven't experienced any errors or bugs in the app.
1,Too much updates !!!! Worst update.... keeps lagging ....
4,When will you have reward points?
1,Bat ganun palaging iupdate badtrip
5,"I really love it, because you can now register to your favorite promo easily🌟🌟🎉"
3,
5,
1,Bakit laging kelangan iupdate yung app?
5,
5,
1,"What a forceful update... Please fix this. Updates should only be pushed through mandatorily if it caused bugs that affects the hardware it was being installed.. if it only fixes the app bugs it should be at the discretion on user to update the app... honestly, updating the app when it only fixes something miniscule are irritating"
5,
1,Puro Update Nalang Lagi
1,I have updated it twice in a row now. Now it's saying update now again .. what's happening?? It keeps on updating every single day. This is worst. I like the old version. Hate it!!!
3,I like this because easy to use but I don't like the fact that it keeps updating so much time consuming and we need to spend just to have load and update the app
2,
3,

1,"always update, but no changes"
1,BALIK NYO NALANG YUNG DATI!! LAGI NAG PAPA UDPATE!!!!!!

1,"Keeps on asking me to log in into my account and updates the app (Ive updated the app for 3 times in a row already for this week alone) i prefer the older version of the app way back when its still not a gigalife. App functions did not change at all except for the new name and icon look. Still promos dont have accurate information as to how the data is distributed specially for surfing data, stories, videos and games. its not clearly explained."
5,
1,Always updating activity when i used the apps...
5,I do really appreciate you're work but may be u guys want to add a dark theme on this app because whenever i open the app it's so bright 😭 and it can even save some batteries This is just a suggestion though i hope this app can be downloaded in freebasic so that some smart user can download it too😇 Keep up the good work👏 SMART
4,
5,
1,The app suck and your services
1,"Worse.. the old app is way more better.. Evryday update!? Wat daaaa f***********"""
1,What the hell always updating. Very trashy!!! It will occupy all the free memory on my phone. Ugh!
1,"really smart? how many times do i have to update the app? and take note i couldn't open it unless I'll update it, and its not free to update! fix this mess!"
5,"Everything's fine with the app so far. One suggestion is if you can provide an option for auto renewal of subscription , it would be a huge ease for us users. Of course there should be option to cancel auto renewal in case we wanted to use a different subscription. I'm glad this kind of app is now available to local mobile networks. I was able to use this kind of app when I was living abroad and it seems quite similar minus the auto renewal option. Hope you can work on that."
1,Good
5,
1,
5,
5,
5,
5,
4,please add also the famload promos for smart bro so that we just need to open one app instead of opening mypldt. overall good improvements

1,Srsly? Always Need to update ? I like the old one than this.
5,love it
3,
3,"Do I have to constantly re-enter my phone number when opening this app? It does for me. Might as well go back to using *123# to check my balance and subscribe to promos. This is one area where your competitor is way ahead of you, since I have their app and it is way better. 9/15/2020 Still a little buggy but better than when i first used it."
1,Just keep updating
2,
5,"okay lang , puro update , ano kami msyaman"

1,"THE PREVIOUS APP WAS SO MUCH BETTER! THE NEW APP, I JUST UPDATED IT THE OTHER DAY AND EVERYTIME I OPEN IT, IT KEEPS ON SAYING TO UPDATE AGAIN AND AGAIN!!"
1,😓
3,
2,it was okay before the update but now the app always has a lag. so annoying
5,
2,"I suggest that after the Smart Number had entered, you shouldn't request for more. Cancel the Pin Request anymore cuz it is just a hassle. I checked my WiFi Smart Load here but the Pin Request is very hassle. I need to uninstall and install again this App just to enter."
5,
5,
1,Slow connection
1,an app of a multi-million telecommunications company that is not working. tried to reinstall it for the enth time and still not doing what it should do. we really cannot expect great internet service from SMART if their simple app is not even working.
3,The previous version is way better than the current. Encountered errors and takes time to open
4,Just fine.
5,
2,
5,
3,Do I really need to update this app everyday?

5,"I love it more ,,,nice app from the smart keep it up"
5,Ok
2,
5,
1,I dont really understand why all the networks in the Philippines is taking tons of money sa mga tao. Dapat pag sinabing unlimited data for all usages hindi yung may access sa ganito tpos limited.. ang gawin nyo 500 pesos unli internet monthly! Makukuha nyo lahat ng tao. Sa malaysia 350 pesos unli internet!
3,
1,ok
5,
5,
5,
5,Sa una nag hahang sya after ko iupdate. Tapos ang ginawa ko inunstall ko sya and kahapon ko lang ulit na download. Ng chineck ko nagging ok na sya. Ok naman tong app na to kasi madali akong nakakapag register. And marami silang freebies.
5,👌

5,
4,I updated the smart app coz it requires to update in order to be use but why I need to update it again? I actually like coz it's very convenient. I hope you can fix it as soon as possible. I know it's hard for people who are trying to fix this but please fix this one for us consumers! Thank you.
2,Previous one is better. Why change the name to GigaLife? it's really confusing. Is Giga the new name of your telecom?
1,Need to be update everyday not usefull apps
3,Ok
5,

5,
3,"I keep just updated yesterday then later that day i need to update again when i wake up i updated it, again!!!! Bruh, My Data is running low"
2,"Why do i need to update the app everyday?! This is not helping, the old app does the same thing and more useful...annoying!"
5,Bubu mo
1,
1,"Disappointing. Why do you keep on making updates when there's no major issue ongoing. Whilst I have no issue with downloading it many times due to high amount of bandwidth, think of your other users who are relying on your application and only have limited bandwidth and low to fair internet speed."
5,
4,
1,Sungak2 sa data. Dugay2 update. Kaurumol.

5,Good
5,
1,"I just updated the app two days in a row and now its asking for another update?! It eats up my data subscription! And after updating, there's no noticeable difference! It's the same app. I hope you make it complete and easier to use. Better stick with the name SMART and not change it every now and then. I was looking for the smart app but after one of the updates it got changed to giga life! Better stick with the company name for easier recognition and IMPROVE the SERVICE offers!!!!!!"
5,"1 star, taena ibalik nyu yung dating model ng smart, hahahaha joke, mgaanda syang app, super duper convenient. Sana may pa libreng load smart. Hahaha"
5,more free data 🙏

1,i just updated it and then it will say update again.
1,👏
5,
1,Can I just use this without updating it everyday????
4,I updated yesterday then today it says I need to update again. Do I need to update this app everyday?
4,
5,It's green because it's SMART. It's their color. I like the app. The update changes the view platform but evrything else is just the same. This makes it easier for me to put load in my smart pocket wifi and avail their Giga offers.😊❤
5,
4,This is really helpful and convinient to manage your prepaid load and promo registration. #GigaLife is here
4,
1,
4,slower than before..more complicated
5,
5,
5,
5,
3,Continuous forced updates. Just updated twice last week and now there is another one.
1,The Smart app before was better than this new version. (giga life) . It always need to be updated.
1,Kaka update lng update nman Anu ba nman Yan .

2,
5,
5,
1,
1,can you please lessen the update thingy of this app or give us an option not to update this giga app. you are forcing us to update in order to use this app. it's really annoying .!
3,"IT SAYS IT NEEDS UPDATE BUT WHEN I CAME HERE IN PLAYSTORE, THE APP IS UPDATED AND DOESN'T HAVE AN UPDATE ."
1,
1,I love the older version coz the new update sucks.
1,Panay nalang update

5,
1,Always need to update. The old one is better
5,Ok
1,
1,It says need to update but no available update on google play store
2,why is it like there's a new update everyday?????????
3,"The app is okay i can check my data usage constantly. Always have a update for the app, i understand that it needs to fix some bugs but can you do it once or atleast a month for the update. Also why i cannot load FAMload in my smart simcard since PLDT promos and sim are under smart.. Okay, i just edited my review and speaking of update. Again encountered an application update, ano yan twice a week kau mgrerelease? Or time to time na pgtagal?"
3,
1,too many updates
5,
5,
5,
4,Im giving it a 4 star for now cause i know that you just want us to have a great experience about this app but if the new update is available you cant use the app and thats a problem to me because in my area you need to find a good spot for a good cignal *123# doesn't work on my phone in my area so this app is so useful for me the only problem is that you cant use the app until you update it hope that you'll fix that =) then I'll give this app a 5 star
5,
1,
5,Its ok

2,It keep telling me to update the app. When i already done updating the app
5,
3,
3,Why do you even need to update it whenever there's an update.. can't you just update it and not make it mandatory to be updated every time ? What if the older one is better than the newest one?
1,Its sucks.. everytime i open the apps.. need to be update.. i just update maybe the other day and now need to be update again
1,Keep on asking update
5,

1,Update after an update after an update
1,THA WORST APP ALWAYS UPDATE 😡😡
5,good anytime
5,Fun its so fun
4,Keeps on verifying every time I check my balance. So much waste of time like I receive at least 10 OTPs every day kasi lagi ako nag checheck ng balance ko using this app. Very inconvenient and disappointing.

1,"App is always updating, not a day that there is no update. You are giving 1gb for 50 pesos and globe is giving 5gb for 50. what a shame for smart users. I think you need to add more data to your 50 promos. Not just simply making you app better! make your promos and service bettee first"

5,
1,
3,Updated the app 13 hours ago. It worked at first but for some reason it went back again to the issue that it won't show accurate amount of data left when I checked my balance through the app. This keeps on happening. I love using the app on checking my balance because it's quicker that way.
3,Please paki palitan nyo yung picture ng babae na lumalabas pag open ng app. Ncre creepyhan lang ako sa face nya.
5,Its ok na man

5,
2,"I hate that this app keep crushing even though i have data, also the internet connection is so slow even this app can't load like seriously! This is your app and you can't even open it by your data connection? It is better to use *121# rather than using this app."
3,
1,Why always updating this app? I update it yesterday and then i update it now ? What happen to this app smart? I change my review if you fix this problem thank you

Please adjust like we can update once we have already registered for network promos.. Also i just updated the apps yesterday and when i open today, still requesting for update.."

2,
1,
1,I DONT LIKE UPDATES
5,At first I rated this app 1 star but after all the updates I now love this app. Thank you for listening to us. It now helps me to see the balance of my sims. Its helps a lot since my brothers are so lazy to download and register on their own so Im the one who register their load for them. Thanks a lot Smart. Good job!
1,Too many updates old version is better
1,"Everytime i open it, it says that it needs to be updated eventho i already did or else i won't be able to use it. The previous uppdate is waaay more better than this new update. 😖"
1,worst. I have nothing to say. tsk
5,
5,
1,It's always need an update. It can consume my data. Really hate this new version 😡😡😠
5,
5,
1,Why always update?
1,always updatibg tapos halos di mkapag register dahil sa ayaw ma open yung app🖕
1,Too much update
2,I just want to suggest if maybe you can make this app as a Smart store that we can shop using our load balance. Because real cash and load balance is just the same. If that happens I would be really happy for the app and also for my load balance will be much useful than just subscribing to data promos.
3,
5,
1,Just updated the the app yesterday and today it asked me to update it today.
4,
4,"It is very helpful to use this to monitor your load and data usage but when it comes to the update, it seems like I am getting confuse of different designs from time to time. I think it's okay after 1-2months but it requires an update almost every week. After all, it is useful. 👍"
1,why always updated everyday

4,"The new update feature better than the past update. But I'm experiencing now that if you will open the application you need to sign up everytime, maybe fixing that would be great 😊"

1,it was pretty good before but when i updated this apps became worst.. I didn't like what's happening..Do i really have to keep updating it? though it doesn't work nice?
2,"The app is very smooth and gets better everytime. BUT, my concern is why is it always needed to be updated every single time. Whenever I opened it, it states that I need to update it AGAIN in order for me to use it. Damn."

1,Too many updates
1,Just updated it yesterday and for just 24 hours you're asking to update it again? Like what the?
5,hi mas ok sana kung nasasave yung number para di paulit ulit input thanks lalo na nasa pocket wifi yung sim. Update: 4 stars for now. The idea is to save the number in the app and ask only OTP once upon saving the number. should minimize all the resources and it will be convenient for users as well. update: 5 stars. hearing customers feedback is an A+ . kudos to the team fixed all the issues
1,Bakit puro update hayssss

1,
5,
1,Frequent updating is irritable
1,"It was working the first time I installed it. Since then, there has been 2-3 updates all of which suck! I do appreciate that you listen to feedback but how about you try it first before launching so that you don't have to update every time!"
1,
1,Are you serious? I just updated this yesterday and now I'm required to update it again?
1,Every time I will open the app it needs to be updated. What the heck! Update everyday?
1,Poor connection. So I can't access the app easily.
1,
5,
5,
2,"I can register my Load Quickly . Thanks- this is my previous rate But now? I hate it a little bit. I like the old version. This version gives me head ache. It's getting worse. Hayst too much. - here we go again, I tried to do what you've said. I uninstall and re installed but when day passes. There a sign telling me to update it again when i opened the app. Like what the heck? Such a waste of data. I gave 5 star in the first place and now , I'm very disappointed"
5,
5,great
3,"This app is great, but please, minimize the number of times you update this app every month. It's starting to irritate me every time it asks you to update it first before you can use the app. I already updated it 3 times now for this first 2 weeks of the month of September, 2020. Thanks."

4,"4 stars na dahil na improve na ang app. may palibre na data pa sa pag update, sana tuloy tuloy na sana to. ang internet speed nyo na lang ang dapat na ayosin pa... 2 stars lang dahil hindi nakaka download ng updated app kung walang data balance. Kung i defer man ang downloading, dapat gagana parin yong app. Hindi dapat naka charge sa subscriber ang data usage during updating. Sana maka pag inquire rin nang data at balance kahit wala nang data balance."

5,
5,
5,
5,Nice! The app is now much better compared before where you have do the OTP over and over again and the new interface I love it but I suggest though that you put a keep me login button so that users will not login over and over again everytime they open the app or put a fingerprint login option.
1,
5,
1,There's an update everyday.

1,
2,awesome
2,"Please, please, please stop forcing us to update the app every time a new update comes out. Do it once every 5 new updates or something. It's really annoying. What if I don't have a data connection to update the app and I wanted to open the app to register using the app because there's an exclusive promo that comes up? Stop doing this. Please."
3,
5,
3,"I love the app, but you keep updating it which make it close to annoying. The old version is much better."
5,Nice apps

1,
1,wth is happening? this is the 4th time that I updated this app
1,
5,
2,Slow internet connection
5,
1,
1,It needs to be updated once in a while so you can continue using it like we dont have a choice but to update it
5,
1,"This up is useless unlike to the apps of globe telcom ,globe one all you need is in that apps but this up making only space in phone so i uninstall this app"
1,Poor service. Everything is stupid in this app. Useless.
4,
5,Nice app

5,
5,
1,"Kailangan ba talaga laging may pa update? Sa halip na lagi akong mag update ng app nato, I prefer to uninstall it. 🙂. Walang kwentang application. Dami nyong katangahan smart, bat di nalang nyo ibaling ang gawain nyo sa pagpapalakas at pagpapabilis ng signal nyo hindi yung kung ano ano ginagawa ninyo katulad ng app natong isang malaking kalokohan.! Mas ok pa yung smart app."

1,Every time I open this need to update all the time 😟😟
3,Turning the app to the way it is now is a big mistake. The update made things worse.
5,nice
5,
1,"Very frustrating that this app CANNOT be used/opened whenever there is an update pending. Why aren't promo purchases applied serially? If you purchase the same, or different, promos twice - they expire when your first promo ends. Rip off. There also needs to be a promo that's purely for data - without being tied into FB, YouTube etc. Also, why does service (speed) deteriorate when within 50mb of the limit? The same service quality should apply to every single mb that's purchased."
1,Just how often are you going to update this app? Been updating this for 2 days in a row.
3,

5,
1,
3,
1,
5,Excellent
2,
1,The heck is wrong with this app it keeps updating every twice a week
5,
3,At least allow users to still use the app even if not yet updated. Don't limit users from using it just because they decided to delay the update for a bit.
5,
5,
2,Did not open since the update.
5,is there COC10?
5,Can you please send a notification message like maybe one hour before our Giga promo is about to expire so that we can share our shareable MB pa instead na masayang lang? It will be highly appreciated!
5,"It's workings good for now, thanks for the immediate action."

1,Puta kayo gago kayo tangina nyo pinahirapan nyo pa kami mag globe nalang ako
2,I like the old design and it is always updating
4,"The app was considerably good when the latest version of it was made available into the public, it comes with 50 mb free data to download the latest update as compensation for the lagging and crashing issues that literally disappoint most of Smart consumers."
2,"The reason why I installed GigaLife was to track my data usage because I need to spend it wisely. Your updates cost too much data especially when you update too often. I have no problem with the display and graphic design but please lessen the frequency of your updates, please."
5,
5,
5,
1,I hate it that it always askes me to update the app.. Wherein i dont see any significant feature on the GUI.

1,I can't use the app if I don't have data so I don't really know what's the purpose of this app so i uninstall it. I'm fine using *123# to register any promos. In addition your data offers are so expensive that's why I'm using Globe lately. Bring back the Giga Videos with 2GB everyday asap.
1,Can't login properly. It always says retry
5,
5,Nice sim is perfect to my online classes
5,Great app! Please add a data promo for zoom meetings app. Most of the students and teachers need it for the class.
5,
3,It would be better if we can still use the app withoud updating it first. 🙂
5,
5,"I like the app, modern design. Easy to understand. More reliable."
5,
5,
3,"If this app is not updated, it is rendered useless. There was a time, I was not registered on any promo and I need to register via this app, I cannot use it because it is not updated. I suggest that this app will still be usable even if it is not updated yet. I hope my comment will be useful to the update of the app."
1,"Sorry to say this but why change the older version to this if what we can only get from this is lag and a lot of loading, logging in, and it is time consuming. Not effieceint at all"

1,Can't open the app since the update.
1,low internet signal
1,"The new update sucks, why didn't you put a description on the new promo. I was like scammed it was just a normal giga video promo. You guys suck so hard, I'm so dissapointed in you"

5,Xciting
5,
2,I thought they have free 1 GB so i installed it but they dont ugh... But i dunno if this app is good or what ....

1,"Dear Devs, Why do you need to weekly update your app that like the last time I did a comment, from the first and second week of September and again for this week you required to have an update THRICE. FOR THE LOVE OF WASTED DATA WHO THE F REQUIRES AN UPDATE FOR THREE TIMES ON THREE WEEKS??

2,My subscription expire on giga video..but when i check it i still have 1day to use that 1gb allowance but i cant play any video's😒😒😒
3,
3,"I don't know why there's not much information about compatibility or even android version information.. And the loading of the app is taking too long .. By the way ,, my Android version is 4.4"

1,
4,"I can now register other offers without dialing *121# with this app, this app makes easy to register even my sim is on pocket wifi. Keep it up 💪. I also suggest that we can register to a promo without updating first the app because there are only two button update or cancel, when I cancel it the app closed and I can't register, how am I supposed to update the app if I can't register to a promo? Please make the app usable if we cancel the update. I will rate you 5 star thank you."
5,
4,"No doubt, I love the design of this app. It's friendly, clean, and beautiful. Can't say anything more but “good job Smart.”"

1,
1,
2,Too many updates.
1,
1,"This app always need an update version, very hassle app. We just want it to be efficient and nothing more."
1,it forces you to up date
5,
5,
4,
3,"Had it updated yesterday and now its asking me to updatep again. Also please if you can remove the log in everytime you will be opening the app just like what you have before. Its not convenient at all. I had my number verified already. Edit: I wrote this review sept 13 and today, it is seotember 16 10:55 pm. magtagalog na lang ako smart ha?! Anunaaaa? Kaka update ko lang update na naman? Pknangina naman! Nakakayamot na sobrang hassle. Parang araw araw ata kayo nag uupdate ah? Anong trip nyo??"

4,"It works fine for me after updating the new gigalife app. Other than the new cover, everything is fine."
1,kaka update lng update ulit
5,"this is a great apps, i give 5 star because i can help to check my balance, it's so easy.... im not ganna dial #123* for checking my data balance"
5,
3,"Well, the update is good but if you click the 'check usage', you can't enter at all or the screen will turn black or it will force stop. You have to log in again and again to see everything. Edit: same issue also and it's getting worse, the ""check usage"" button isn't working. We have to log in again. And I hate seeing faces of celebrities."
1,
3,Worst update at all...please fix ur app.
2,"everytime I open the app it keeps saying ""Update now"" how many times do I have to update the app."
5,
4,Still NO Face ID/Fingerprint support just like what they claim that they added to the update. It would be totally convenient if you add that to your Android app as well. It sucks that we still have to login with passwords everytime when biometrics like Fingerprints and Face ID are also a secure yet a more convenient way to do so.
4,Convenient way to pick your promo

But everytime i put a password, i can't sign up because it says i don't any strong password. So i am dissappointed in this new update version."

5,Ok
1,"I don't understand why your giga 99 does not have unlimited all net text while giga 50 does which is cheaper. Maybe you could offer something like 6gb open access data for php 99. I'm stuck with giga 99 that's olny 2gb and 1gb everyday video that i do not need. We need ""open access"" prepaid data not preset allocated data."

4,"The app is good, easy to under stand and easy to use. However there's nothing much difference when you log in and use a quick view, so what's the purpose of log in?"

5,
1,Kakaupdate lang. Update na naman. Mas okay yung nakaraan. Wala ba kayong magawa? Saka tanggalin nyo na yung mga model nyo sa app! It's not pleasing at all. Hindi sya nakakadagdag ng functionality sa app na dapat yun ang focus nyo.
5,Beautiful

5,easy to use.
2,"I would like to raise my concern, smart communication. If you can double the data for games why couldn't you double the data for study instead? A lot of gamers out there but could you even consider that the new normal is online classes? There a lot who really needs double data for study now. Please prioritize the needs of every student and parents and double the data for study promo instead. Thank you PS. I am raising this concern because a student like me who cannot afford to get a monthly plan"

4,"I think you should allow the users to consume more than the daily data given in the promo as long as it still falls within the total data allocation of your promos. Kasi, ang hirap kapag magpresent for instance sa meet, tas 1 gb lang dapat magamit mo, so kakainin na niya yung shareable data mo. Eh paano kung naubos na?

My only gripe for now is that it doesn't automatically log-in when you open the app, it does view the details of the sim you're using, but if you need to see the other numbers, you need to log-in manually. Hope this will be fixed. Regardless, great app and a must-have for smart and tnt sim users."

It's time to buy another provider's SIM card. 👎👎👎 After the recommended reinstallation Gigalife App still does not work, Google Play Service requires me to update. You can't force me to install such an app, what I don't want to have! 🖕🖕🖕"

3,Good
5,
1,I still don't know why we need Gigalife when there is mySmart app. Why not just improve your signature app? Smart means Smart... Gigalife is not a brand that you will remember. Very disconnected user experience. Some features of mySmart is not on the new Gigalife. Bad bad bad.

2,It does not have the giga promo that i use (music) so I can't even use the app as intended because I only want to use that promo and not any other promo
1,So much update without any vital changes in the app .... and I haven't received my free data yet after I loaded my number. Scammer
3,Why not try paypal as load payment transactor
4,
5,
1,Di ako maka-log in boset!!!!!
1,"The older version is better, now it cannot log in if there is no data"
1,Can't register to a promo. Always try again later. Done with troubleshooting with the app and my phone. The same result
4,Okay
1,Very poor app. Just done updating because it won't open unless you updated it first. Then another upgrade again? Do I need to upgrade this everyday??????????????

5,
1,"This app is not working on my Xiaomi cc9, very disappointed.. 😭😭😭"
1,"Keeps logging out everytime you open the app! Update: Tried restarting my handset, still the same thing. My device is running MIUI 12 if that helps since Xiaomi's flavor of Android is known to be problematic with applications sometimes"
5,
1,"Even if I have enough balance in my load, I cannot use my pasaload to other smart accounts. It always says that I don't have enough balance. It is so disappointing."

1,"Its useless for those people who does not have wifi. You cant use it if you dont have a data. Lol. Also, they always notify if they have freebies using the app only. Again, How could I avail if I dont have the data? I often use The dial number for subscribing promos instead. Its more accesible than the app. PS. You can check the balance but you cant subscribe to promos. Hows that?"

1,I'm about to register my SmartBro number but then the app is full of bugs. I mean the entire app is not actually working. Even though I'm using Android Version higher than 5 and I have no internet connection issues too. Still the app keeps me in log in form. I tried to log in again but its still the same.
5,
5,Nice app
4,
3,Can access the services even without load balance. Please include a paypal payment option i don't want to wait 2-3 days just to be able to load prepaid
4,The application works fine and very convenient for balancing or even when I need to register to a promo. However the catch is... The login process is not that ok. Please improve that and Can you add the function that we can Pasaload or Pasadata? It would be great if it has that feature. Thanks!
2,"The login process, the worst in this app"

2,i just availed of giga 299 almost 2 weeks ago which is good for 1 month. y is it that when u updated this app my subscription for 1 month has already lapsed so disgusting!. Restore my subscribtion back please.
4,
5,
1,"Overall the app is good its just that its so bothersome that everytime you would want to check your balance you need to log using your number, cant you just make it as pin so it would so much easier. I've put my sim card in my pocket wifi how would that even help."
5,
1,How many updates you want?
5,
5,
5,
5,helpul
4,
1,The recent update is so stupid. I have to manually type in my number each time? Really? Edit: they responded and called me Taylor 😂. Did not help at all.

5,
1,I have registered in giga 299 for 1 month then ung 4gb naubos na di na ako nakakapaglaro ng Call of duty mobile but the other games like mobile legends nakakapag play pa ako. Ok sana service kaso parang may mali
5,
5,How to avail
5,
5,
3,"I like the new offers specially the Smart Giga Fest however there's something wrong about the game data. I'm always subscribe to Video and Games. Giga games has now 1GB everyday but it takes the 2GB whenever I play games that are not mentioned. I tried GGames-2 and I'm playing PUBG yet the data they took is from 2GB and not from the game everyday. One thing too is the extra data that we can't EXTEND, I always save my data and it always goes to waste whenever it expires, we need Extend Offers pls"

2,"The app won't recognize the OTP for quick view when I'm accessing the internet using mobile data, it only recognizes it when I'm connected to a wifi network. Very annoying considering the reason why I'm registering a promo using the app in the first place is because wifi is not readily available where I am. Please fix this."

1,The whole day today it's not working.. It get worse today compare the last few days..

4,would be cool if there was a giga free use promo
1,Love the idea of having an app to see my usage and promos and be able to register and subscribe with ease. But you must first be sure that it is working correctly and properly! This app... No... All your apps are buggy and not so convenient to use in times where i need to see check my data usage balance or subscriptions and so on... What if you have just 1(one) that can manage and does all and that can work correctly? Instead of releasing multiple apps with the same bugs and same problems!
5,Been using Gigalife offers since pandemic started. So amazing promise 😘

3,"When it first released I had no problems using it. However, starting yesterday, I can't use the check usage anymore. It only shows a black screen then the app becomes unresponsive. I'm using Android 9. I'm not sure if this is because of a recent (auto) update of the app."
1,"Kong pwede lng lagyan ng -star, yan ni rate ko🙄. Rason kong bakit? Nag regester ako ng gega video sabi may 1gb plus 1gb araw araw(youtbe at ibpa). And then wala pa kalahating oras wala na agad 1gb plus yong 1gb 4 youtube ano yun?, scammer pla to eh. Sana sa *123# na lng ako nag reg. Unang gamit ng gegalife pangit agad experience. Sayang ng load ko."
5,
4,Nice app ..
5,
3,I woul love this app more if this has a point redeem system wherein if u buy a regular load you can have one point and points can be gathered to redeem freebies and data promos just like the globeone app ( because I'm a globe user recently). Also the ratio would be 50p regular load = 1 redeemable point
4,"Just update right now but isnt responding?thank u for sending another update today nice to see my usage data...thank u giga life godbless. Now its fine working in good shape gigalife,hope more improvement in the future.god bless gigalife"

5,
1,Piece of s**t app. Just put the giga promos back on smart app. I need to load a SmartBro router for my business from my home. This app never works well unless I am loading it from on-site at the Smart router. Smart app much better. Please put back giga promos there or make this app support use from a different network better.

1,I wasnt able to proceed on the application after the terms and conditions show. Please fix this issue .
5,
2,How can activate fingerprint login? It's too cumbersome to type my password every time I login. There is no App Lock function in my Gigalife app in my Galaxy S10. In my iPhone 6S+ there is an App Lock function. Why the difference?
3,"pls include all existing data promos in the app, there is no giga music in my gigalife app"
1,"Asks me to update and when i tap on ""update now"", it redirects me to playstore without the option of updating, just uninstall and open. Tried reinstalling the app, but same stuff happens. No wonder the app has low rating on playstore, it's unusable. Edit after dev reply: Why would u call me Nelson though? Anyways, it works fine now. Better gui and increased security by implementing a login and otp feature. Good to have feature: dark mode and an option to adapt current phone's mode(dark/light)"
1,walang kwenta ibalik niyo nalang yung 2gb free every day + 2gb data! 7 days For only 99 hindi yung 3gb free + 3gb data for only 199 tangina pandemic na nga nang gogoyo pa kayo ng tao

As tnt user, I always use that and often register to those promos, but it's gone. I don't know but would you mind if you would include that again, please! It's a pleasure to hear my request. I was still gave you a perfect star because I know you can make more better features in the future."

5,"It is so useful to me when I first downloaded this with name ""Smart App"" but the reason I gave this 2 stars is because when you guys changed irs name and when I updated the app it stopped working. It freezes after I get in. The options of Subscriptions wont show up and I cant even press the ""Check Usage"" since it's freezes. I've waited for several minutes and it just ended in a ""App Crash"" I wish this was still the ""Smart App"" since it's so suseful and very functional."

Aside from that, what is the point of using this app if it doesn't work at all when you are out of load. It opens so slow, and time consuming as well. I got to stick with the *123 for now. App needs further smart but easy improvements."

5,The latest update has both good and bad. The good - Login window is now visible when you open the app. Response is much faster than the previous version. The Bad: I can't back out of the GIGA Life front page after I logout. I would have to resort to pressing the home page and close it from the stack of opened apps. It not a big deal for me but it may be a problem for new users.
3,Need to fix the bug of the app
3,Gosh. why do I need to update this app every single time?
3,frequent update consumes data fast

1,"Unbelievable. Everytime I open the app there's always an update. I cannot open my account nor register to any promos without updating the application in Google play. Seriously? I can understand if the update is all about bug fixes but ""adding another feature again?"" Why bother? Before adding another feature, please fix the crashes and bugs of this app first!"

5,
5,Very good.
1,"3 days ago, I wrote a review/complaint about the background photo of the app (a photo of a random female). Then an update came. Nothing has changed. Just changed that photo to something a plain green background with logo of smart will do. Not some unattractive female with unsettling smile. Makes me uncomfortable."
5,
5,
5,👍
5,
1,Always keep updating the apps. Why don't you put some additional features like you can extend the promotion that the customer using. Instead of updating the apps.

5,
5,Its good that this app lets me monitor my balance account and load. Hopefully you can indicate the full list of codes. Thanks for improving this app every now and then.
1,App is too inconvenient. 1. Phone number not automatically retrieved on this version i.e. the user must memorize own number. 2. Quick view requires OTP which is very inconvenient for non- mobile phone users. 3. Login is needed to check usage - shouldn't be.
4,
3,hmmm i think its better i give 3 for now 😁
5,"Overall, it's a useful app. User-friendly and practical to use. It's a seamless app experience for me yet."

5,This app helps me so much when because I've been using pocket wifi. The good thing is just open this app and register a promo without opening my pocket wifi gateway. I wish that something feature that tells me how much data that i consume on that day or have data limit usage feature so that i can monitor my data balance. I rate this 5 star

3,It won't exit the app by pressing the back button after the latest update.

1,"Before the update it was doing good but after I updated the app my remaining load balance reduced from 152 pesos to 33 pesos. I'm subscribed to a promo, so that means my remaining balance shouldn't be touched even if I'm using my data subscription! I'm so disappointed.

5,
5,
1,I tried to register my postpaid number and it's saying No user found.
5,
3,This app should be accessible even if we are out of data.what if we had purchased load balance after our data are expired or we forgot to renew the package after using all our balance? In other countries you can use network app even if you have no balance.
5,
5,
5,
5,It's good cause you can register fast and easy so less work for someone as lazy as me lol
2,Signal of smar t is poor
1,"I'm getting an error saying ""User Not Found"" even if I am just signing up ☹ Even if I have a Signature Postpaid plan 😓 Done restarting device I've reinstalled the app as well Made sure the sim was inserted in Sim 1"
4,
5,
5,
1,Why is this app need to always update??? A waste of load 🤔
4,
1,"UPDATE: This problem still presists. I don't know what the problem is but I CANNOT find giga study 99 anywhere. The lowest one I can see is ₱199. I tried contacting smart through twitter but I am left unresolved. It's so inconvenient if I have to remove the sim from the pocket wi-fi every time I'd have to register. It's only convenient to check my data balance but if I have to remove my sim everytime I'd register, it still defeats the purpose of this ""GigaLife"" convenience."
4,
4,
4,
5,
1,
1,it keeps on updating and it so suck! just stick what you have done !
5,
3,the promo itself are way better than before however still useless because the internet connection here in CEBU CITT is waaaaaaay tooooo sloooooow!!! Im using a 3g or H+ internet connection in my area because 4g connectivity won't work!
5,
2,PURO UPDATE NAKAKAIRITA
5,
5,
1,I like the older version.
5,
2,What is the Real and Official Smart App? You have a bunch of apps confusing your customers. Can you make up your mind and stick to one? I don't see the point of creating several apps if the existing one can just be improved.
1,PURO UPDATE PUTAAA !!!!
5,Salamat sa Gigalife at magandang gamitin
5,
5,
3,Ang hirap gamitin....

5,Very convenient.. excellent app..😊😊
5,
1,Does not work. I can't create an account. Plus it's redundant with the MyPLDTSmart App. I don't ubderstand why we have to maintain too mant Apps/ Accounts???
1,
4,Everytime i open it i need to enter my number
5,So pretty
5,

5,
5,
5,"This app works great for easy access to load balance, to check usage, even for your history in load and promos. However, please.tell me how to remove a number that is linked to an account/number? There is no option."
5,Good app for balance inquiry and other services
5,
5,
5,"fast using,convinient"
5,
5,Nice
5,
1,I used to love this app because it was very helpful for a student like me. In this update they lowered the addtional data from 2gb to 100mb real quick. The app always logs me out and the app says I don't have any data subscription when I just have a few minutes ago.

5,
5,Wow......wow only

5,Okay
5,
4,"Great app tho, But it doesn't have smart rewards/smart points to redeem items and please add a affordable promo like 10 php 20 php for 100-500 mb no expiry"
5,
5,
3,This app is good but I think it would be better if there are freebies or incemptives for those who use this app.
5,
3,

5,So great
5,"As for the latest update, Malaking bagay na naconsider ng Smart yung concern ko dati about sa sudden updates. THEY SENT FREE (100)Mb.- even though less than 10mb lang yung update- Very commendable guys, I appreciate the hard work. then Speed, mapagkakatiwalaan parin tulad ng dati( I guess it varries from place to place tho). Pero May promos parin na parang walang kwenta tulad nung GigaGames, Limited yung variety ng games/unspecified yung iba and those games doesn't really use high mb in a day,"

1,At least let us log in even though the app is no updated....
4,"The app is great and easy to navigate, but the problem is that it keeps on logging out. Maybe you can put fingerprint encrypted since most of the phone has this feature by that it won't be hassle to login and put your password manually."

Giga Video option is now in the app which is perfect! UI is very nice except details of info looks clickable but not, may be remove round edges & replace with regular. UX is good too. Ill make it 5 stars when all crashes vanishes."

2,"A nice app overall... but its behaviour when it comes to upgrading is unacceptable. Basically, when there is a new release available, the app will not allow any use but demands that the upgrade be done immediately. This is just rude. Of course, users must be allowed to decide when to upgrade... so they can do it when they have time and a good connection etc."

5,
4,
4,The app requires you to update every week. This is a hassle as I cannot transfer the app to my memory card and I have to delete other apps in order to accommodate it. Reply: every week to update? It's not rocket science to know what an update does but it is a hassle when it has to be done weekly.
5,

2,It's good since you can find better offers and promos than dialing *121#. But it sucks 'cause I can't pay using my visa card account. Always a failed transaction. And I really need it right now too.
1,"My smart simcard have a signal on it but cannot connect to its data connection, I cannot use my allnet text, I cannot use my balance either."

4,I have a dual SIM device. My prepaid number works but it's not letting me add or register my postpaid number. Too bad .. Update: Reinstalling the app worked! I have both postpaid and prepaid enrolled. I hope you can also add the feature to send load and data like on the myPLDT Smart app. I'll try to see how the bill payment works on this app soon!
4,
1,"I'm (not) satisfied with this app, but there are a couple of problems, one of them is that whenever I get a free 3 gb of data or something, instead of using my video/study everyday, it uses the free data. Which makes it a waste of data. Please fix this, it's costing me a lot of money"

5,
5,Satisfactory...
5,
5,🥰
1,maganda siya kaso walang katapusang update!!!
5,"I like this app. This gives us a more accurate record or balance and expiry dates of registered promos. Like the one's im using when i'm in europe the Three Sim. They give accurate details as to how much more data we have and an easy option to renew it. Though still need to monitor if using this app would consume your data. They did say that it's free to use,. But it doesnt hurt being more aware and careful."
2,
3,
5,I thought there would be some freebies or spacial promo if you download this app. There's nothing spacial. 😑 Edit. Its better now i think..

1,For me it doesn't useful at all because how can I open it without data or WiFi and I'm afraid that my load will only consumed and deducted if I open my data and the app together so I'll stick with *123# for now but I need it for securing my data consumation
1,"ano bang app nato lagi nlang mayupdate bat di nyo nlng ayusin ng minsanan, tinitingi nyo yung app lagi nlang kyo may update, kung pwd kayo irate ng no star gagawin ko e, dpat khit may update mbubuksan pa rin khit di muna iupdate, pg naiinis ako idedelete ko nlng tong app na to!!!"
2,"Let us open even if theres an update! How can we update if we dont have data, we'll have to go back to dialing *123# which making the app so freaking pointless!"
1,Why do i need to log in? When i can see my balnace and everything? Why there to many update that consuming my data balance? Hello? Another strategy? Tsk.. tsk.. not good.. an accurate update regarding with our balances. Laging late ang dating eh.. minsan wala ng load 24 hours pa bago dumating ang buddy balance..
5,

1,Puro update
5,
5,
5,"I love the app! And Can I suggest one thing?? Can You do the 3days, 1gb for google meet and hopefully, It won't use the other data.. hehe :)"
1,"the app always freezes ... still the same even if I uninstall and re-install, I cant subscribe to any promo, always say ""try at a later time"" and then when I switch to other promos, it freezes :("
5,
4,"We should be able to enter this app even without update because if we are in emergency, we need to update the app first, we can update this app later if we have time, you should also include a fiture that can message another user and see our unread message here"

Please improve also if there's a new update please dont force us to download the new update to use the app. You know we only have limited data most of the time. Thats not what I mean.

1,"1. Instead of using the free 3GB/day data allocated for Youtube, Teams, etc. it uses the regular data (unless regular data is completely consumed). Regular data allocation (6GB for P199) is too low and expensive compared to Globe's (8GB for P90). 2. You need to log in every time you open the app. 3. You can't log in unless you update the app. 4. Poor costumer service."

5,"I just downloaded the app yesterday. This is a great app to monitor your data usage. My only concern in this app is, everytime I open the app it required me to always put my phone number to login. Update: They now updated the app which you will not enter your phone number everytime you open the app. Great job for the developers."
5,
4,"This app is really good when it comes to promos, balances and expiration. The only thing is, it needs update from time to time."

I needed to type my number and password all the time. 2nd need to open my mobile data just to open the app or else I'll get a ""handshake"" error. What is the use of this app if your *123# is more user friendly? Update for Jamie: Hi! Only two options in GigaLife App - account profile: Login info and Logout account. Update 09Oct20: the app doesn't offer my favorite promos (e.g. Sakto). I've run out of space to comment!"

1,Why is it that the Giga Surf Pro Game has no support for Giga Games 2? I chose GSP because of the 6gb data but i cannot utilize the the free game data because CoD is not supported? Curious why you chose to limit the supposedly better subscription. Please for the love of sanity make your service better!

1,Your Giga study promo don't even work in entering of any sites in google👎
1,Smart promos are TOO PRICEY! For 99php you can only get flat 2GB data and that's it! Globe promos are way way better! For only 90php u can get 8GB + unli ALL NET! Super budget-friendly esp in this time of pandemic and everyone is working/studying @ home. You need to take a look at that.

1,Stupid app. It automatically log out your account when you close the app. While some other app like globe when you log in and then close the account stays log in while in this app when you close the account will log out also. STUPID. CAPITAL S T U P I D. STUPID!!

1,walang relation sa app comment ko pero customer support nyo di active at bastos sa consumers.. ayaw mabigyan ng critic sa service nyo kaya ignore nyo messages ko sa messenger. good one smart.

5,
5,
5,
3,"I like the app but the New update is not good. It constantly displays ""input your number, too many requests"" something like that and it flickers your display and you cant close the app, cant even go to home screen, its like a boot loop, all you can do is restart your phone,"
3,So it seems to be working but why doesn't your app have a delete feature to remove linked accounts? Talked to your twitter support and hotline and they can't figure it out. Weird to lack a basic functionality. ------------------------ So far so good. Unable to link my other smart postpaid account though. I keep getting the d1.a.a.a.h error so I gave up.
5,
5,Yeah
5,Very creat
5,"Good,awesome"
5,

5,nice
3,You should include VIU to Giga Video 1GB everyday.
5,
5,
1,poor promos
2,"App asks that Google Play Services have sms permission, whether granted or not, the app doesn't remember login credentials nor phone number, so really bad UX having to login manually every time. App doesn't have fingerprint login either. Apart from that Smart Giga data promos not so interesting, can't be extended like Globe's GoSurf50. I took Smart (Prepaid) SIM thinking there would be promos to call landlines but apparently those are only available for postpaid customers."
5,I hope this app next time will not consume data anympre and with promos if we dont have load in case of emergency

1,Didn't recieve the free 2 GB data after registering to GIGA STUDY in the app.
3,Smart user ako mula pa nung unang nagsimula ang Smart at nagkaroon ako ng sim. Sana may promo ang Smart na open access lng. Mas madalas ksi unang nauubos ang open access ko kpag nagloload ako ng work giga life. Sana mapansin.

1,It doesn't seem to be working tho.
4,
5,nice
1,The DoubleData offer on 10-10-2020 gets consumed first instead of the 1Gb Youtube per Day. I'm subscribed to GIGA VIDEO. That's lame. Am I supposed to consume all the open-acess data first before I can use the 1Gb data allocated per day for YouTube? Instead of the other way around.
3,
4,"The app is great, it lets me see the important details about my sim (like the load balance, promo, data usage, and etc), and also they sometimes give free data when you register thru the app. But I noticed that the Free Data given always gets used up first when I'm watching on YouTube even though I still have the Free Video Everyday from the Giga Video promo. I know this is not an app problem but I hope smart can do something about this."

1,"As much as I'd like this app, I'll give 1 star to none. This app requires an update all the time and it's annoying. Hey Smart, why can't you just let your app be. Updating doesn't even make sense nor changes to the application's capability and function."
5,I love how convenient this app is to use. However I can't seem to find Giga Music in the choices of promos to register. I use it quite a lot so I would appreciate if it gets included.
4,Its quit good. Just need some fix. I love the app its easy to use and how to check my data usage. Just experience some bugs and then the app crash. Like when you choose more in the stories option. The app suddenly lags you cant subscribe the 399 one or the 499 stories. The app just hang and you need to remove it on recent to use it again

1,My signal was so poor😭😭😭😭😭😭
3,Allow us to use the app even if there's an update. It's very difficult if we have to update the app and we have to register for a promo. How are we going to do that if we can't access the app? Fix this issue.
1,안되는거는 왜팔아?

5,Cool
2,"Still on 2 stars even if it has been updated to 'GigaLife' app. I still encounter the same issue. It keeps logging me out everytime. Registering to services through the *123# is way faster than going through a lot of hassle to retype your number and password. Or I guess, the number of touches you pressed on your screen is just the same. Not helpful at all."

3,"I love this app better because of the freebies. But sad to say, when they notify you that - this or that day has a ""double data offer"". But when you subscribe to your favorite data. Either way, what you registered became useless by the time being that the double data was sent to your account. Because that's the only data THAT IS BEING CURRENTLY IN USED. When it SHOULD HAVE BEEN STACKED to your GIGA PROMO — (shareable data). Please solve this issue. And would really rate this 5 star. Tnx."

1,"I am a 12-year Infinity subscriber. The Inf app has been useless for quite a while now. Just sayin ... no better service for paying more. If this new app will replace MVP Rewards, which is useless for more than a year now, what happens to the Cignal & PLDT accounts registered there? No more rewards for the two?"
5,
1,

2,"Its way more easy to use *123# than this app. Don't tell me that after removing text you're also removing *123# so this is the only thing remaining. Take note, i was just force by Smart to download this app because i think its way more convenient than the other. Now, its vice versa. 😏"
5,Matipid sa load
1,the app is always not working!
2,"this will consume more data. if you have 50php load and you're attempting to launch this app to register any promos worth 50.00, your load will be lesser than 50...that's why you will not able to register instead.."

1,"Absolutely useless. Can't even sign up much less log into the app. When you try to sign in up, the app displays a ""404"" error. ADDENDUM: As of 10/20/20 the app is still malfunctioning. I was finally able to log in, but it won't display my usage stats; it just keeps telling me to ""try again later."" Still not recommended."
1,I can no longer monitor my pldt prepaid wifi data usage just like I used to. Please fix it asap! -I used to monitor my data usage using the same app before. Include pldt prepaid accounts back!
1,"You said you will double the data when i register on either oct 17 or 18, i registered on 18 but my open access data didnt doubled. Why?"

Its been a nightmare trying to register the second account specially i cannot take the simcard out of my pocket wifi as it damage the sim. You guys should know that. You cannot send the one time pin to the pocket wifi number, it does not recieved messages. I have given my tnt number it should be sent to that number instead wifi number. Honestly it was better before. Now is all a mess."

1,"After I login, screen is just frozen. Does not respond to touchscreen inputs. I was only able to go to Home screen or multitasking screen after I pressed the wake button to turn screen off/on. Switching back to the GigaLife app, it is still frozen. Cannot do anything else except enter multitasking again, then switch to another app, go to home screen, or force quit GigaLife. So, app is not useful at the moment. Also, why does it need a separate login from the original MySmart app?"
2,I dont know what's problem but my internet connection or data connection is getting slower everytime i test it 1.8 mbps but in 2019 smart internet connection is much faster the fastest i ever recorded is 29.1 mbps like what......

4,"App is now working after reinstalling. Also, since it no longer crashes, the number is now retained for login, and only needs the password to be entered. Can't locate the mentioned desired app lock option: I only have the Change Password option under Profile - Login Information. Perhaps that feature is unreleased yet? (Updated as a reply to the developer's comment.)"

Tried on both wifi and using my smart data. Just decided to uninstall it. Reinstalled on Oct 26th today, the app still keeps hanging up! One would really expect a better experience, given the fact that Smart is a telecommunications company! So it's embarrassing that you can't even get your app perfected!"

4,"App froze upon entering the otp code. I use android 5. Update: I manage to bypass it using another device. It seems my device can't process the pop-up user agreement hence it froze.

2,"The app is good, a bit buggy sometimes that it doesn't open but it's fine. The problem is your promos. Your promos for me is really bad. Not only the open/sharable data is small but also limiting the apps that can be used with each promo. Why not just make a whole bundle and give users freedom? Well this just my opinion and I only use data when our WiFi is being retarded.... *Cough *cough pldt"

3,"It always says under construction when being opened. Edit: Issue still recurring. I am using pldt prepaid wifi. Hence, if I remove the sim card on the device the warranty will be voided Edit: Tested the app using smartbro pocket wifi and the app is working.

1,I don't know what's the reason but I tend to always log in all over again when I use the app. It's so hussle. You need to log in your numbers and password everytime you want to check your balance. Edit: I still experience from time to time logging in my number and password when I check my balance. This is the most hussle app I have ever used. If I could only choose zero star. I would choose it.

One thing also, kindly put the YouTube and Tiktok in one promo please... Thank you 😊."

I know you wanted to keep up to date, but would you install them and initiate in one go? There're only subtle changes, nothing major. Why would we spend more for something little? We're just being practical here, we're all not rich. Thanks. 🤧"

1,"This app is quite useless, i only download this is to see how much data remains on my free videos but it isn't and putting the prepaid sim on slot 1 is quite a hassle since my smart sim has a problem on slot 1 and this app isn't that good either because the only promo it offers is only data it doesn't offer unli call or text, etc."

2,It's not even working. Is this app requires high version of Android to operate?
4,Works just fine for me. The only problem is it doesn't exactly tell how much MB left I have for the YouTube on GIGA Video. Please track how much data is left daily and it should be perfect.
4,
5,

5,
1,I dont recieved my FREE P50 cashback has not been credited. On my number.
5,this new app of smart are very incomplete of promos and once you register your number it will have nothing useless then the insure security of simcard after register also nothing and useless. better if complete for promos and secure the sim for data usage to track. by this new app. almost taunting to this app ano pa inaantay natin gusto ko maupdate. thank you.
5,Nice
4,Much better than other Smart Application but you should improve the data usage. You should also include when will the promo will be expire. Like the way you use on the My PLDT SMART APP and this one is more convenient it doesn't send messages and logout when. You're trying to use the app again.
3,
5,
5,"Wow, Smart already get so much faster here in San Mateo, Rizal thank you for it. I dont know what happened but that is good news right? I was once using another telecom but its really slow then I started using smart, and Im surprised it was so much faster. Im playing Mobile Legends and watching yt videos a lot and Im getting the best experience off of it. Thank you for that."

4,Useful
4,"The user interface is elegant and consistent across the board, however the main panel can be used to show more data/ detailed information to save users time in navigating the app. I'm hoping for the support for Postpaid subscribers as this app is far more useful for the said clients."

1,I am trying to Register in GIGA STORIES 50. I have a 254.00 balance. It keeps me unable to to register as it always says that I'm my balance is not enough. Does your app know how to count?
5,Its true..
4,"Hope in the next update, it will show when will be the expiration date of our current subscription."
5,
4,Good
2,"The only upside for this app is the usage monitoring feature. The app frustratingly lacks a description feature whereas users should be able to view the description of the promo and its inclusions. The app doesn't include all the features you find in *123# like the Giga Video+, why is that???? The app could be good but it's just so bounded and limited like it's almost static. Hoping you'll address this for the next update."
4,"Bagong app pero walang bago sa internet speed, bulok pa sa bulok. Game: LAG Youtube: buffering Always loading.. ... ...."
5,
3,"It disturbs me to see an app that everytime i open it, someone is smiling at me. I think there's no need for the model to be seen too much. I think i will also be better if there is some guide inside how to locate stuff and also some description in the promos. And i notice there are some data redundancy appearing in the data usage."

3,There must be an option for selection of universal pin so that there is no need enter the otp again and again. This makes this worst. It should ask otp for only once at the time of registration.
5,
1,"kada i oopen yung app need pa ilagay yung number at ibigay ung OTP. hindi nyo ba kaya yung naka log in nalang talaga yung number para refresh nalang tas lilitaw na information? hindi yung kada open ng app ilalagay pa ng paulit ulit yung number at OTP.... not reliable, iniba nyo lang appearance (UI) or dashboard pero ganun parin sa dati. tsk.. tsk.. 👎"

3,Working for now. I hope you guys will add other smart mobile numbers instead of just one. It'll be easier to check other remaining data and load just buy tapping on that certain smart number than having to type the number again and again. Just like in the old app. Also you should add descriptions on the promos listed cuz it just says the amount of how much it cost and days. Dunno what's the promo about or how many data that promo has. Put some info regarding all of those promos.

2,"The app needs a lot of work doing on it still. Several times, I have tried to top up my internet with a PHP 50 package and received the message, ""insufficient credit"" ... The app is reporting that I had PHP 701 credit, so its impossible that there is insufficient for PHP 50. I tried again this morning and it actually worked, so it appears to be an intermittent system fault. The most reliable way to buy an internet package is still to send a text to 9999. The 1 Gb of YouTube doesn't work. I watched a documentary of half an hour yesterday and the money was deducted from my internet quota and not the so called ""free"" YouTube. You cant top up your account using the app, the mySmart app is very unreliable so there is only about a 30% chance you can purchase online. Internet speed and availability continues to be abysmal. It indicates 4G but speeds are 3G at best. We are on the corner of Eduque and Makati Avenue in Makati, so it should be far better. The system down time is also very high, so extended drop outs are experienced frequently. Smart is making some progress, mySmart didn't work at all for around 6 months last year, so 30% availability is an improvement. Keep at it and we will have a functional system one day!"

4,Mas ok tong app na to kesa dun sa isang Smart App. Mas convenient siya lalo na sa pag register sa promos. Wala ng hassle sa pag log in ng pag log in sa app direct ka na agad sa balance mo. There's still more room for improvement for this app.

3,Sana free na lang ang pag tingin sa promo yong dika na mag bubukas pa ng data.kc useless nman kung kakaload mo lang tapos dipa nag register kc titignan mo pa ang mga promo.di ka mka pag subscribe kc kakainin na load mo.kc nka open na ang data.kung e free ang pag open ng apps mas maganda.saka lahat na ng promo na gagawin nyo pati sa *123# ilagay nyo na sa apps nato.pag nagawa nyo ang mga sinabi ko maraming mag download ng apps nto.

1,"The app needs more work and more reload/payment options. It would be great if you accepted international credit cards directly ! Anyway as long as Smart doesn't fix it's slow buggy intermittent network it doesn't matter much. I've been in communication with @Smart (doesn't) Care for months and they don't actually do anything but ask you to send your details over and over again. All my neighbors have also contacted them, some for years now and nothing has been done for the Candau-Ay area."
4,Pls give some warning about the data subscription!!!
5,Its Good
3,
5,
5,Galing
3,Unnecessary but convenient. It doesn't save your phone number so you will have to enter it everytime.
1,I have sa sun cellular sim card and this app will never let me see the balance of my sun cellular load. I couldn't express how disappointed I'am. I feel like I'm paying for nothing. I also tried to use the *123# but it won't work. First thing is that you're not doing very well with your pldt internet and now this. I can definitely see what's happening here. You're just all about the money. You can't take a good care of your consumer.
5,Very nice

3,I have a problem. My GIGA VIDEO 99 promo uses up my Open Access MB instead of Video Every Day MB when I watch YouTube How do I fix it? Please reply.
3,Edit: Recently updated the app (05-01-2020) and yet underlying issues presented by other users still persists. E.g. Video Everyday doesn't reflect data allowance (rather static) un affected and OTP requirement when phone number is already registered still persists.
5,
5,

1,This is an issue. I cannot use the play prime to high consumption apps data. I have a strong to moderate signal please fix I already sub. I want a refund if you can't fix
3,Why do we have to input an otp just to check the data usage? Besides it is very inconvenient to remove sim from the modem device to a mobile just to get the otp. And when I tried it it wont work!

5,"As long as I have regular load, I can register to my favorite promos. Please include more promos like All Out 99 etc. Thank you"

1,This app keeps on asking for my number and OTP. It doesn't have any technical support option in case we need help. I didn't know that theres an 8 gig cap for data usage of a prepaid account. Your customer service representative even recommended to use a different number and network since they cant fix the issue and then hang up. So might as well put a tech help on your app so we can fix the problem ourselves without talking to rude customer service rep.
3,"This app keeps on logging out my account so I need to set it up multiple tines a day and I can't even do something about that. Another problem is, It keeps on logging and freezing when I need to check my subscription or transactions"

I just want to know if its intentional or not, and also if you guys dont know the term offbrand just look it up. And I know Im asking for too much but please increase some of data allowance for some of your promos."

1,"This app keep forgetting the number I set. Everytime I open the app, it will ask for my mobile number again. So annoying!! This happened on two of my mobile phones ."
3,The Free Stories for all option is missing for me. Do you guys know why?
5,"My problem to get my money,and then me is nothing assistants nothing support me is Only one, here me is muted and also error, but me is OK kasi alam ko na Malapit ng sumikat ang araw nating lahat buong mundo Ay may pagbabago, Dba mga kaibigan , and also my head heart,"

1,"putanginang app to, palagi na lang update, nakakabwiset din, letse"
1,No new rewards after reloading even big amounts. This is trash. Always having an update but no new stuffs are added. Total trash
5,
3,
2,I am trying to add load and using my debit card for payment but the transaction always fails. What should I do?
5,
1,
2,Its good but requires you to update to register for promos which is annoying bcs it defeats the purpose of this and I have to dial instead when theres an update and I have to register.
5,Good
5,
5,
5,Clear and fast to comunicate
5,
5,
5,
5,Speechless
2,"I was trying the 'add load'. Provided all informations about my card but then I'm not able to receive the OTP it requires to process the payment. Is there a way that can be sent via email and not by phone number? I've checked, my number associated to my bank account is current. But even though I try the resend OTP there's still none."
5,

2,Why i can't acees using 4G data my youtube fb etc it didn't load only 3G but its to slow can you fix it already its almost 2 days it happens plss take some action thank you
1,"Scam! The description given in GIGA STORIES 99 is 2 gb of surfing plus 2 gb for FB, Tiktok, etc. But then, when I register to a GIGA STORIES 99 and checked for data usage it gives only 1.02 gb for stories! Such a scam! I don't recommend this SIM! Even in surfing! Too slow! I can't even open fblite this whole time! I think it's time to change SIM! I think It's okay to Globe! Even their promos are cheap still the internet connection is efficient! Even the COC10 have been removed! Zzz!"
4,
3,"Needs more options, I still use the *123# because it has all the promos"

5,Not sure
1,why can't i subscribe to a promo when i already have enough balance?. it just keeps saying that you have insufficient balance.
5,
4,It was ok...
4,
4,
5,
1,"Great App, no payment methods. Only empty screen on add payments window. Totally useless. Smart rocks in providing no internet for the full price!"
3,
5,
5,
5,
5,
1,"When will postpaid subscribers be given access to this? Hindi po kasing makapagregister sa boosters through *123# pati rin sa site, hindi. Lagi nalang sinasabi na may connectivity sa server."
5,
3,"The ""One-Time PIN"" Verification keep popping up every time i Log in. Its annoying. Also waiting for load transfer or Data transfer feature in the app."
5,
5,
3,
1,Everytime I open this app it always ask for an update. It takes time to load what a waste of time. We get nothing on this app. No special promotion or rebates.

5,
1,Chain validation failed. I can't use the app
5,
1,Not good

5,
5,
1,"It should be zero star because i try to register the GIGAVIDEO and it says that ""Awesome! You can now enjoy 1 GB VIDEO EVERY DAY for YouTube, NBA, iWant, iflix, Cignal Play + 2 GB for 7 days with GIGA VIDEO 99."" And then boom 4 hrs had passed my data became 50 mb only. Sucks, that fast? Goshhh"
5,Nice
5,
1,Lag
5,
4,Not satisfied
5,
1,"I have downloaded this app and any time of the day I am always offline (I cannot log in with this app), also my data is very slow, freaking slow, what I saw today in my news feed in any of my social media account was the same as yesterday. Typically, it will change, if this 4G will become 4G+ (in my signal status) thats the time my news feed load's new news feed. Unfortunately, this 4G+ thing will only last for 2 seconds after that I will wait for tomorrow again (honestly?EVERYDAY). Disappointed"
4,Hello can i also load someone using my acc? Like example gusto ko po loadan si mama ko and naka connect naman bank acc ko.
5,Good
3,
4,not nessesary
5,i love you smart app...
5,
4,Nice app
1,"Naka indicate lagi 1gb sa video everyday, hindi tuloy malaman yung exact usage ng video, mababawassan nalang sa shareable data kasi naka indicate lagi 1gb."
5,
5,
5,
5,i llike it
3,"it sucks because this app only good for data subscription, it has no option for other promos especially for those minimum promos for unli calls and text only."
5,its ok...it helps
5,quick nd nice to folĺow this app
5,
5,
5,
1,Di niyo po ba talaga aayusin yung OTP? Why do you have to log us out all the time? Ayusin sana
1,Not amazing
1,Does not show free youtube data. When you load giga 50 then giga 99 the free youtube does not refresh even they are diff load and even if you already consume your free yt in giga 50. Just now l registered using this app with giga stories 50 to get the extra 1g and it is only showing 1g.
5,
5,
5,
2,
3,
5,I hope you include in this app the rewards history if ever there is one. I hope there's a reward for every load like Globe Telecom.
5,How can I get some money
5,
5,Good as iknow
3,
5,
1,Always updating 😑
5,"In any case remember, SMART Telco. you are as yet in regards to DNs, Tunneling and Bypassing.. On the off chance that you release Free from Data Charges, next update in this application, simply Reminding.."

2,No rebate or discount?
5,
1,"Keep on coming back to login, is this really functional or just a trial run? Old version still working and good."
2,
5,
5,
1,very poor
5,
3,The 20% balik load is not working. I have been registering to GIGA promos and im not getting that 20% balik load. Hope you fix it.
5,Good mabelis
5,
5,
1,Nice
5,

3,
1,Connect data all
5,Excellent
5,Buti pa yung App nauupdate pero ang bagal ng internet🙄
4,wish you added function to allow purchase of epins since gamex seems down.
4,
1,Cannot get past terms and condition agreement.
1,No other option for load except GIGA. No discount unlike if you load in paymaya.
5,
5,
4,Convenient checking balance is great but it doesn't show the exact balance in the Giga Video pane unlike on the stories pane...
5,
1,"Useless app, Poor app"
1,"This app requires Internet connection to log in your number, and it always requires cod otp which bothers me a lot. I rather use the *121# because it doesn't use internet connection."
5,Good
5,
5,
5,Good
1,Mahina signal
5,
4,"Good,"
1,Keep asking my number. Irritates me. Uninstalled!
5,
5,Works great! But what's consistent is the monitoring of data usage with watching vids which does not work well. Also have the UI cached so it wouldn't always need to load. The number as well.
5,
1,This app does not have the TNT promos! I expected it would have TNT promos.
5,
5,Nice
5,
5,
5,Good
4,it is helpful to track my usage
5,
1,"always no service, I'm playing ml and suddenly I dont have signal because of system shutdown pls send a notice before shutting down your signal."

2,Not reliable ive just installed it and registered using the app then it wont open says im offline
5,"It'goooood..!;):) It's f.i.n.e...,!;):) It's perffeeeccctt..!;):)"
5,
5,
1,A total waste of your money and time in developing this app. You should have rather improved My Smart/myPLDT apps. There is nothing new in this app. I find myPLDT more useful as I can manage multiple accounts with the app.
3,
1,"why is it I have insufficient balance to get the Promo I wanted? i have 108, and trying to access worth 99.00 only and its insufficient 😑"
5,

5,Rate this app
5,
5,
5,
3,Why is that don't have enough balance when i tried to register on GIGA STORIES 99? WHen i actually have 103 pesos on my balance?
5,So cool love it
3,"Upon downloading and checking how this app work for me, so far so good it shows the current balance and current internet usage i alreadry consumed but my problem is the smart connection here in our place supposed to be we have an 4g internet signal but unfortunately its just h+ and thats my biggest problem with smart everytime I open my data connection it really suck I even go to the place where the signal is okay please Smart make some effort to fix your smart data connection here in our place"

1,
5,
4,
5,
5,
5,
2,Please remove your OTP and have a permanent log in asking for only finger print or password just like globe. I am using a smart pocket wifi and it is incovinience if its asking OTP over and over again whenever I am checking my load balance and data usage.
5,
4,This should be flagged having sexual content. Please remove / replace your wallpaper... I get into the intro screen and all I see are the cleavage of your model. Which is really inappropriate and gives me sexual tendencies. Please make the app more child friendly . Thanks.
1,
5,Very good
4,Okay
5,Usefull
1,"Smart is very slow, this is useless.The signal is very poor, i can't browse anything..huh!!!!.."

1,"How annoying everytime I want to use the app I have to reinsert my cell no, and put in one time pin, why is this? Uninstall coming!!!!!!"
1,How to improve your account and how to add you balance how explain
1,"totally useless app, i have to enter my mobile number everytime i open the app."
4,
1,Nawawala net ko😠sayang yong load😠
5,
5,Its way better than the old one.
1,Seryoso!!?? Inupdate ko pero hindi na magamit. Ano ba yan Smart.
4,
5,Can't see the status of free stories.
5,
3,
1,The first time I installed this app it works properly but when I updated the app suddenly it doesn't work anymore. What a bad update it always asking for otp and when I input my smart number it will exit abruptly from main menu. Now I can't monitor my data daily.
5,
5,Very convinient for data registration.. i can manage my data too. Thanks to this app..
4,
1,
5,
5,Good as I expected
5,
5,

3,Your new update is not working. Can't go through on the registration.
5,
5,
4,
1,Do not appreciate forced updates... Your app bad
5,
3,I give it 3 stars because I think this app still has room for improvement like for example in the check balance may we can view the balances of any of our subscription plus when our subscriptions end or expire. Thank you for taking time to read and consider. God bless us🙂
5,
1,I just updated the app few hour ago then it is requesting to update again. I hope you'll fix this.
5,
2,
5,Its very helpful because i know how many mb i have..
5,

1,How to use
1,"Demands for load is high, im dissapointed because this app was built for load to ppl who cant go out because of quarantine."
5,"So far everything is great, except it's very hard to registered to all your promo and sometimes it does not get to the exact date and day to expired, I still like the way it was before,"

5,
5,
2,1) Lack of context. 2) I cant use my data connection right now even I have a full signal.
3,
5,
1,Sabihin niyo naman kung may maintenance kayo para alam ng mga smart users
3,The app is good but it could be better if it can be used offline so that it won't be a bother to waste mobile data while having a transaction And if only you dont need to put your number everytime you use it cuz it's kinda getting annoying

1,"There is a huge flaw in this app and that is the update is persistent, when there is an update the app promts you to update first and you can't use the app unless you do it. Which is stupid as hell, what if I don't have a data? How am I supposed to download an update when I am supposed to use this app to subscribe to data promos? *123# is not always reliable, Smart FIX THIS ASAP. We should be able to access your app even when outdated, Jesus Christ no one ever thought of this flaw?!"

1,"Tried to Update the app since it's mandatory.. and it won't update. Nice try Smart. Next time, before launching an update, have it tested first. Don't you guys have testing team? I would love to volunteer if you didn't have any. lol."
4,"After the update, I can't register to any promos. Only my load balance was shown. I feel bad cause this app is the only way I can register to a promo . For an unknown reasons, an error always pops up to my screen when I try to dial *123# or *121# (Connection Error or Invalid MM code) . Please put a promo registration to this again , this is the only way I can register GIGA promos."

5,
5,
1,
4,Okay then. 6 mb lang naman pala. But I guess it's better na we can still open the app kahit na hindi pa inuupdate. Kasi wala naman akong naencounter na issues previously.
3,It would be better if the can access like we can found in *123# if you can put those thing in this app it would be be sure better..

5,
1,
1,"Smart, I think you should make this application offline to use. I mean why we need data to access this. What if we want to subscribe to promos how can we access it if we need data to open when we don't have data. And also I know it's a beta but it update frequently and also I don't notice anything every update the only thing I remember is the Buy Load option that's it. It need many improvements but I think the best way to improve this is making accessible without internet"
5,
5,
5,
5,ok
5,very good !

5,
3,
5,
4,
4,
5,Very good idea
3,"I find it easy to use, but there is a major flaw. First off the update is persistent, it's not like everyone has data to keep updating the smart app, The reason we downloaded it in the first place is for the extra gig when subscribing to a promo. And how can we subscribe to that if you guys keep on being persistent on the update?? Please think it through. Or atleast add a feature that we can use it even if it's not updated."

Improve nyo po yung dati nyong app or bago kayo mag release ng ganito, ung exciting. Ganun din ung *123# or *121# nyo, ang hirap gamitin at very limited sa mga options. Then every time you open the app again it will ask for my mobile number, hassle. Walang kwentang app."
5,
3,
3,"I hope they improve the app by accessing easily from your WiFi modem thru ur fone so you can monitor ur remaining data balance. No need for pin, just input ur WiFi smartcp# And no need to transfer the simcard thru ur fone just checking out ur data balance."

It's true that I received it and according to the message it will expired after 7days, but when I checked my balance today the said 2gb free data has gone though I didn't use it since I received it. 😢 😡"

1,"Always NOT available upon login. Reinstalled the app, checked Sim1, still the same. Always SERVICE NOT AVAILABLE"
5,Nice
5,
1,"Always having to put your number in and password everytime just to check your balance is horrible. Please make it with fingerprint verification with saved logins please! Pls make a ""check usage"" widget. where you can add it to your home screen and always see your usage."
3,
2,
5,How
4,Good
5,"I hope I have the option to skip the update every single time. I just want to check my data usage, ending.. I have to update first the app every single time before I can check my subscription. Total waste of time."

3,"The promos i need, Giga work 50 and 99 are not available. Only giga work pro is available Update #2 regular giga work 50 and 95 are available on my sun sim but not on my smart sim. So I'm revoking 5* back to 3* Update #3 I know where to find regular giga work when it's there, but it's not. On my sun sim, it's inside the More Giga tab. On smart sim, it's not on the front page, so when I enter More Giga tab all I can find are video+ allnet and all-in. I already reinstalled the app twice but same"
5,
5,

2,Needs internet to work. Could have been better if it can access your current registered promos without connecting to the internet. This will be a big help especially when you are not registered to any data promo or when you are in an area with a slow data connection.

Haaayyy.. 😒😒 Update: Done as you suggested but nothing happened kaya 1 star pa rin. Not surprising to see that the rating of your app is 3.7 dahil buggy talaga. Haha

5,

2,BRUHHHHH 2 updates in 2 days sa minahal mahal ng service ng Smart Telecom walang enough funding para sa app development. the promos sucks too. this monopoly (duo) is getting out of hand. at asan na ang Zoom sa promos niyoooo?
5,
5,This app it can double my data when register in any giga
1,"Havent received my free 2 GB after subscribing to giga promo. They said that I could get free 2GB if I do so and the freebie will be credited within 24 hours but its already 48 hours. This app is a scam. Also their FB page is not active, Ive sent my concern 40hrs ago but still didnt received any response."
5,
2,"Its a good app sana, kaso everytime I open it, I'm logged out again and it asks for a one time pin which is annoying because most of my field work are on areas not covered ng smart signal or mahina talaga signal. So ganun din I still can't check my load or data kasi walang OTP na marereceive."
3,"So that is, I bought a simcard with tnt and yep! As expectation run through, as I can see that theres an additional 3gb FREE FACEBOOK activation didnt happened or credited to my account so heres the thing, Im just hoping that is, like me as a new smart user would do, PLEASE COOPERATE WITH WHAT YOUVE BEEN PUTTING IN YOUR SIM CARDS NOTICE COME TRUE. 'kay? And also within the app, Im just having trouble with exiting, we can use the backspace instead a direct home button to press just to exit."

Need to know when I used my regular load and details about my daily video load... Details, details, details... You ask me to review my review of your app... No If I could give you 0 stars, I would...! I make 2 to 4 transactions a day yet your app says I have no transactions, it simply doesn't show them..."

4,"Definitely one of the better Smart apps. So far, my only issue is there's no way to stay signed in. I'd prefer if i could just open the app to check my balance straight away. if security is a concern, perhaps connect with the screen lock like most banking apps do?"
2,"Di naman gumagana, wala ako mapindot sa app. Hirap pa mag log in"

1,Logging in is too much of a hassle. No fingerprint or face ID option. And your reply to this of having an App lock option is totally non-existent in the profile section am using android by the way. The profile section only contains 2 options which are Login Information which contains the mobile number and the password AND Log out Account.

1,DONT BUY LTE A SMARTBRO POCKET WIFI IT'S TRASH. THE PRICE OF 1995.00 DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE PRAISED. IT'S PURE TRASH. And you can't access the SMARTBRO Portal via MOBILE which is kinda complicated. It's not a user friendly device. ALSO the device don't have a wifi repeater feature. 제로반 They offer LTE-A with an OLD MODEL VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. DON'T BUY SMARTBRO IT'S LIKE GLOBE PRODUCTS IT'S PURE TRASH. ROT IN HELL #NTC FOR NOT TAKING ACTIONS AND JUST TAKING BRIBES FROM SMART TELECOMMUNICAT

4,"My problem about the app is fixed now. But i have a complain about the Giga Games-2 promo because when i play Call of Duty Garena version, it should consume my 2gb data everyday for games (i am currently subscribed to Giga Games 99, but same applies for Giga Games 299 and the promo can be found in Free Games inside the app) but the shareable data is being consumed. Is it because the Call of Duty app im using is the Garena version? Btw, the global version of the game isnt available in phillipines"

1,"When i log in my account, it is stuck on loading (preparing). Last time it works perfectly before the past updates. Now it's useless. It's stuck on preparing. UPDATE. THE FIX YOU'VE SAID DOES NOT WORK. Been doing that on different devices, the issue is still the same."
1,I cant eben attend to my online class or play mobile legends because of your network it says 4g but it acts slow the slowest network in the Philippines

1,Registration to promos is working well. Giving this app a one-star due to an unposted payment. Payment was made the payment last month but until now it is not yet reflected on my account. CS channels are confused when asked. Exercise caution when using this App for payment. I would suggest using other channels for payment of Postpaid dues.

Thank you very much"

1,Everything here was expensive. Its better to use *123# . On this app you can't find a budget load...

I will adjust the star rating depending on future patches/improvements. Edit: kudos for the speedy development enhancements. Everything is now showing up. And the ease of renewing the subscription is really a great feature. Good job! Edit: after the latest update, it is stuck at the ""Preparing"" animation."

4,Well theres an a giga point now but the thing is its hard to gain points. Only 1%? Its hard to gain more points for saving i think this app would be better if you put a mini game that can gain points or something or make it 2% gain of giga points per register just an opinion/suggestion. But ill rate it 4 star this time because of the improvement of this app for giga points. Still great and helpful.
5,
1,always lagging everytime I used it
3,its good
5,
3,"Better than the past apps produced by smart. It is very fast, easy to use, and convenient. But, a big down pull, what's with the frequent updates on the app? It's kinda irritating to update it just for minor reasons. From 5 to 3 stars, don't let your services down or it'll go down to 1 stars... Hope you'll fix the problems and we'll reconsider, thanks."

4,ok maganda naman sya kaso parang kulang pa sa mga features.. Sana dagdagan naman ng ibang features na mas interesting at kapaki-pakinabang. My suggestion is lagyan nyo ng automatic renewal sa sa promos kasi madami sa mga users na nakakalimotan kailan sila ma e.expire tas yung pwede ma activate o deactivate para may laya ang user na e on o e off yung feature na yun. Mas maganda is yung 5 or 3mins. bago ma expire e nag rerenew na sya ng kusa(if may available balance).
5,Activated

All through out very efficient actually get to manage my data usage.. I hope next time there'll be that SURPRIZE option that I see on *123# Menu it gives me more perks than the app provides..

3,I really don't get it why do we need a separate promo to watch more youtube or use fb and etch? Why not just give us the whole data.. 7gb youtube everyday to 9GB DATA.. OR BETTER MORE DATA AND LET US USE IT. GLOBE TELECOM is watching. And we are not making thr SMARTEST move. 3stars for an honest review. Give usmore data and 5 stars will be seen more in the sky. .

1,Tried changing my password but it keeps on saying please use stronger password. I already used mixture of characters but it keeps on saying use stronger password. Like what kind of stronger password you need for it to be changed? Do I need to use a whole lot of characters or shall I use all the characters present in my keyboard for you to accept it as stronger password?

5,I love the free 2G
2,I usually avail promo from this app before my current promo expires.. but this time I'm trying to avail a promo using this app without a data but it forces me to update! How can I update if I don't have a data?! It's funny how it requires me to update when I'm still trying to get a data. What I did was.. I opened the app repeatedly while my data is off.. and when the login menu finally appeared that's the time I turned on my data..
5,
2,
5,It's easy to use and helpful. No need to insert the wifi sim. It is quite helpful to us.

Sana po isama nyo sa promo ang ZOOM app dahil jan po kami nag oonline class umaabot ng 3-5 hours po kaya ubos kaagad Sana po mapansin niyo ito salamat po.

1,I didn't get points after I purchased giga promo. Why just this month you add the points reward? How about the money we spend the past few months? We've been expecting the reward system for years
5,

4,
4,Please add genshin impact to the giga games promo
5,
5,Useful
3,"I like how easy it is to register to a promo, and monitor your usage. But I don't like how it makes you log in every single time with either your account or another OTP. I especially don't appreciate it when I have to update the app again to use it; I just went on the app to check my usage and it wants me to update it... again? Otherwise it's a decent app and it shows you all the necessary information from your device/subscription, and it's so easy to use if not for the aforementioned problems."

But, I gave 4 stars because since the last update, the back button of my phone is not functioning to this app when it perfectly works to others. Also, I couldn't fully enjoy the freebies (1gb/day) because of signal fluctuations especially at night (Nueva Vizcaya area). Hope you could solve this. Thank you and more power."

2,"You should prolong the days into your promo ""giga life"" for example the 149 deal sounds real good but it is only for 7 days. You should also add additional data & you should give freebies to your loyal subscribers. I've had this number for almost 10 years & ever since then every now & then my load has been consumed after topping up my load and not being able to use the balance, I would call the customer service but its no use bec you guys are greedy."

5,great
4,"New update not yet stable, can't log in and always stock, you should fix it guys the rest are all good. Keep it up and also you should add more Interesting Promo like some promos in globe."

But I also hope that you would create a promo for the anime fans (otakus and weebs) too with a free crunchyroll and other anime apps premium subscription. And I also hope that you would let us check our data balance/consumption in the pldt home wifi just like the previous version of this app. ❤️"

4,I love this app because it prevents my regular load to be reduce. I use wifi before with a TNT sim and everytime i load regular amount load it reduces stantly about 5 pesos. So when i started to use the app it's stop and the load is maintain to at the original amount even though you don't have active registered load it is not deducted if you use online messaging app

2,"OTP too slow. The OTP is valid for 5mins only but the OTP is received more than 5mins from when the signup is done. Therefore, the app says the OTP is already invalid. Tried this 3x with same result. The send status to 9999 is more useful but seems it has been removed already."

4,"After installing the app, it said that I need to update it. And the update wa posted yesterday. Idk what's happening 😂. But overall, it's a great app to monitor your data consumption😊"
2,"maganda sana ito kung free access kahit no load data ka,.pasa easy to open and register."
5,The best app ever
4,
5,
5,I love it. i can easily registered to a promo in my wifi.

2,Everytime I open the app it always ask to have mandatory update and it really sucks!
5,
5,
5,
5,Best nandito na lahat
1,"why it needs a strong password to register i typed as many words as i can, every word that i jnow and every word in my mind and it still says ""please choose a stronger password"" i cant register..."

1,Literally. The App keeps getting worst. I tried to sign up and i have to wait 5 more minutes to get the code. And every time i get the code its invalid. Thats right INVALID BECAUSE ITS TO LATE😡 AND THATS NOT EVEN IT. I CANT EXIT THE APP LIKE A NORMAL APP WOULD DO. I HAVE TO PRESS HOME JUST TO EXIT. THE ONLY GOOD THING IN THIS APP IS CHECKING HOW MANY DATA DO I HAVE LEFT. SO PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUES😡
1,"We can't even get the OTP on our number. Therefore, we can't even use this application for our benefit."
5,
3,Its okay
5,So far so good
5,
2,Its really nice so i can monitor my data consumption even my simcard is installed at my wifi but it sucks its data consuming i need to update everytime 🤮 kuripot na nga ng smart sa load ang takaw pa sa data hayss
5,It's more fun
5,
5,
5,
4,Cool
5,
5,
3,Your app is frustrating.. it doesn't let me sign up it always send pin after 10mins and now I'm banned from signing up so mad pls fix this i don't wanna do the old fashion way anymore.....
5,"Uhmm I'm just wanted to say hi👋 to this developers, thank you for making this app its absolutely worth it,😉 as i saw every user ratings here, the only problem is their signal, why? Because I'm a user too and i try to monitor this app in different location or area, which i try the weak and strong signal, like what i said your problem here guys is your signal, if your signal are weak the apps run slow and its always re-loggin, and if your signal are strong, it directly login you, hope its help😊"

3,"This is a great app for me except you can't open it whenever it had a new update and instead needed to be updated first. The reason why I rate it as three stars is because of the pin. I've been trying to add my other sim in my account and every time there's a pin, I will type it but it always says ""this is an invalid pin. Please recheck and retry."" I've been trying for 30 minutes but that's always the result."
5,
5,
5,Its easy to use and tracking your data in a single tap is a big help
1,Lemme know when you finally fix the bug about sending pin code.. it takes forever
5,
5,
5,
5,Secret
1,The app is fake is doesn't even make you make an account it always say (please choose a stronger passwors) but already typed like 60+ characters already

I was expecting to see more giga promos in the future. Random suggestions: hoping u can create a giga promo were we can select max of 3 random applications of our choice that will include in 1gb/perday. So that we can fully utilize 1gb/perday of the bundle. Either this app si good."

During your registration of ""PASSWORD"" you need to wait for five minutes (00:05:00) 'til they send you their so called a ""A ONE TIME PIN VERIFICATION"" but the problem is, you already used five minutes of waiting but they never send it until it become expired and then there were you received it if its not valid anymore 😠!!!! How many times i have tried but still so on and on like i was wasting my time for nothing 😠😠😠😠😠"

1,Why do I need to always log in? There should be an option to keep logged in for like 30 days etc. Such a hassle entering your password everytime you want to check your usage or bill. I can log in faster on all of my banking apps. Biometric integration is a must.
5,This still doesn't recognize postpaid account. And so I uninstall it. Edit.... reinstalled again upon learning its updated version with postpaid account already incorporated. Thank you for this but I will still be using the mySmart application which is much faster than this.

All you care about is YOU making money pero yung consumers wala man lang matinong reward system. Wala man lang din matinong offers for data packages, napakalimited and napakauseless. Data for gaming daw pero limited lang yung gaming apps na catered, you can't even get the most out of your data package."

5,I love this app. I just hope it really shows the exact payment and usage evry month. Thanks.
2,Free data that comes with video 99 is (2 gb) which is good. But viewing YouTube will use the free data instead of the regular (1 gb) for video everyday. I prefer that the youtube data should be allocated for youtube alone so I can make use of the free data for other purposes. I think it is your system default settings? Thank you. And please your cover design is outdated

Also the Doble Data they were saying is a big LIE and is not working! trying to lure us out into downloading this useless App! Most promos are a scam since you can't really use 1gb of their free videos everyday without using shareable MB! Giga games are limited to only 5 games. Uninstalling and flagging!"

1,There is no more GIGA ALL-IN 649 that i usually purchase in the menu. It's a great thing for me that you have free 1GB for Videos and 1GB for Stories. Dati yung 1GB mga 5hrs. ko nagagamit watching live stream ngayon 2hrs. Palang nag notify na that you have FULLY CONSUME YOUR FREE VIDEO EVERY DAY.
1,BAKA NAMAN ! KAKA EXPAIRED LNG NG ALLDAY 20 TAS NIREGISTER KO ULET NG ALLDAY20 WALA PANG 10 MINS NAG TEXT AGAD KAYU NAG NAUBOS NA DAW ! ANO TO LOKOHAN ?

5,
1,Its so hard to sign up !
4,
1,So sad because weekly update and you can not open if you not update
5,
4,Almost perfect but could you please make it so that the data usage monitor be set to contain more digits to more accurately monitor data expenditure or the option to choose between GB and MB as the size. Will upgrade to 5 star if you do that. TY
4,
5,"Hello Smart! The app has a very small glitch, very minimal to notice. But yep, I like your update now. But I may suggest, for the giga points, to include Giga Stories 299. It is just so sad that I was subscribed to GS299 and was credited 3 points only. Hoping that you cater a larger scope for the giga points. Overall, the update is good. Hoping more good updates!"
3,I love this app very convenient and the fact that it gives additional 1GB if you regester to any giga using this app but I'm a bit disappointed to SMART bcause they dont offer unlimited facebook anymore! Why? Im a loyal smart prepaid user here anyway😅

Would you please include to put show notifications on the notification drawer for the remaining data of the app access and all access data so that it would be convenient and we can track our usage easily without opening the app again and again just to track the usage?

4,I'm a SmartBro user and I'll say that it really is convenient to use the app especially in viewing balances and registering into Giga promos. The latest update is great too adding some gigapoints that subscribers can earn using the app. The only problem for me is that I can't anymore see GigaGames on the list of promos under my SmartBro simcard using this app. Maybe you can consider adding all giga promos into the app?

First annoying thing about this is the fact that you need data or wifi, and a really fast one mind you, so basicaly buying load if you dint have load is a no go. 2, its constantly updating even though nothing is changing and you can't open the app unless you update. Third is having to constantly type out you phone number, like cant it just remember it or something its not like im constant changing my simcard."

5,I like this app..
5,
2,"The app is kinda buggy when I tried to sign in I won't let me pass because of the stupid password bug whenever I type a (STRONG PASSWORD) it denies it even when I type a new one with letter's,numbers with symbol...(why did the developers published this app..not usable)I prefer to dial *123# than this"

5,
5,
5,
5,
4,
1,This app is good but the smart signal is too weak or very low internet connection You have to fix it before I break the Sim card
3,I just downloaded the app and I can't sign up All the password I type wasn't strong enough although the password I wrote is more than 8 letters Why is that?
5,Hmm I think my points is 2 hshsh
3,3 weeks na under construction hindi ko maview ung usage ko... Kayo na ata may pinakamatagal na maintenance
5,

2,Unsecure app! I was able to see the load balance of others when I connected to their mobile hotspot. I could have also registered them in a promo without them knowing. Smart should fix this security loophole.
5,
5,😊
1,"Pls fix the app, everytime i check usage it only shows black screen"

3,"This is a great app except for when you register your own giga 99 and it lags, you wouldnt even be notified thatyou are already registered once. Such a waste of money for duplicate same promo whereas youll be only using for a week instead. Hope this can be refunded. And avoided if proper warnings or prompts are being made to prevent double load registration. Thanks!"

Habang nag subscribe ka ng load, mas madagdagan ang points kaya dyan ako humahanga. Kung 50 points ang makukuha ko pwede na ako mag subscribe ng GIGA VEDIO 50 ng libre kaya gyan ako masaya. Thank you very much po😊."

1,"Gigalife app update is worst, I request to indicate all previous load transaction to rebate all the points. Restore it since app is built your'e costumers wants a pair rebates. For almost a decade your company give bad services to filipino people. It's about time to improved your telco. So, in case something does not work as expected, you can rollback your system."

2,"The older version before the update was better. Since I updated it into this version with the name ""Gigalife"", the app keeps crashing and keeps updating. Plus, only ""quick view"" works. Giga points can only be redeemed by logging in. Hence, after logging in, the account page takes forever to load until you just give up doing so and just settle with the ""quick view"" page."

3,The app is good but whenever I ran out of internet and load i can't open the gigalife to see it's information and I can't even register it always says you password is weak need a strong password the password needs atleast 8 characters or more in the end I can't even register now all of my points will be a waste because I can't use it

1,I hate that the app logs you out without the option to auto sign in everytime. Other network app's not like that.
5,Talk in text is so nice signal. Not log if you use.
1,One star cos no matter what kind of password I make still can't sign up lame wasted my time uninstall
5,
5,
4,
4,"Sad to say that the app is exclusive only for giga offers.. i wish developer could add more packages.. smart has alot of apps , why not unified them? MySmart app has sim checker ,PUK request tool, shorcuts to smart websites ,pasaload function and help lines. Maybe they can add them too."

Input ng user ayaw niyo tanggapin, nakaka bwisit, daig pa online banking sa security hanep, uninstall ka hayop ka, balak ko pa naman gumamit ng data sa smart nagbago na isip ko"
4,"The app is actually good with minimal errors. What i hate about is no auto login feature (save password or whatever its name) for ease of use. I get tired input of 9digit number always. Why not try to add a 4 pin instead?. See how gcash works, i hope you get my idea."
1,Poteeeeeeeek walang kwenta!!! Bugok!
5,Ok na ok
3,
5,
1,Why so many updates? You always have to update this app. in a month I guess this app has updated 3 times.
2,
3,"Finally worked after I restarted the app for the nth time. Good and promising app, but you need to log in every time."
5,
5,
5,Good
2,"Just downloaded the app and it doesn't want me to sign up because my password not being ""strong"" enough like, I added many different numbers and symbols and yet still can't sign up. 2 stars because the app works tho."
5,Nice
4,"This is a very convenient app, and I should probably give it 5 stars. However, the latest update just removed the 'Other Promos' section, where you can avail promos for text and calls. Why did you removed it? As if you just want us to always avail GIGA Promos. Bring it back, and this app will be truly convenient to all users."
5,Verry nice
1,dyosko yung load na pang 7 days ....4 days lang tinatagal. ambagal pa minsan. tapos ang mahal mahal ng mga promos nyo. lugi mga nag oonline class sa inyo.

3,It keeps on updating.
3,"hello, the app is great but i just don't understand why i can't sign up. even tho my password reaches 20 characters it is still stating ""please choose a stronger password""."
3,
5,Unique
1,Since the update other promos like ml10 is gone. I tried the *123# its not working
1,是真的垃圾，什么都加载不出来，网站也显示错误，垃圾的不行
5,
4,"This app is great 'cause I can now keep on track the data I consume. More easy than dialling *123#, though it needs data to open. The problem is the updates. It will be best if we still can use the app without updating its newer version. And one more thing, 'bout the redemption of the points. Please add more promos to redeem like Gaansurf because not all Filipinos do always register on Giga Promos or maybe, atleast we can also gain points by loading a minimum of ₱20. But all in all, it's great."
5,
5,
5,Oks lang
5,I've already done reinstalling the app and finished making an account. Thank you for the response. :)

1,"I'm not sure how you can dial *143# via pocket wifi just to subscribe to a P50 worth service. So... Whoever thought of this process to limit subscriber options is either lazy or an evil genius. Seems to be a board member decision, no thinking and considerations at all. Nevertheless, we regular people are stuck between two telcos with low service values. Malasakit and profit can't exist together indeed. Edit update: I'm already using the app but 199 is the lowest to purchase. It's a sham"
2,Someone recommended me this app saying if i register i will be able to get free more data but i wasnt. Free shareable mb every subscribe for giga 100

I know you will say that this is for us but it is really annoying and frustrating to have no other choice but to update. Please know that not everyone has an access for internet and mobile data is really limited. It is also take time.

1,I hate the way your friend's wants your number for them to get 10 gigapoints and when they get your number they could literally control your whole balance you should remove this. Like what happened to me last time my friend takes my number code sends then the got control of my account now because of that they use my balance to get giga stories even tho i dont use that if they subscribe to gigavideo its fine for me but that giga stories i can just use Facebook and messenger. Fix these

1,"At first, I thought this app was good because they have good promos and services. But after using it for about a month I realized that it's not good as it is in the first time. Why? There's an instances that my subscription doubled but I can't cancel the other one because this doesn't have that specific feature. I waste so much money and in an overall view I don't like this app."
2,This app is good before! But they bid some promo products which makes my head sucks!
5,

5,
3,"I cant log in! I tried multiple times to change password and got confirmation that it was successful. But still it says phone number and password do not match. Well im using my phone number on my phone and sure its correct unless smart changed it. LOL!!! Already reinstalled the app. But the other main issue was, when I log in to my account to either check the promos and my giga points. It only shows blank white screen and it looks like loading, without any images or pictures on the screen."
5,
3,Please do fix or add giga points addition via loading from a local store cause I always load random amounts but it doesn't add any points to my account i keep seeing only 10 points to it and also add game promos to the giga points redeem part not only videos and stories (please do take note to your next update thanks)
5,I'm so happy at this app because it Gabe's me 100 mb always I super duper love it🥰💜
2,"I can't link my Smart bro number. Prompting: under construction. Why other promos aren't included like gametime, etc."
5,Useful

2,The app looks good and functionalities are promising but.. it crashes most of the time. The data subscription options are very limited and no options for higher data tier.
5,
2,"Why d ""others"" is missing? I can't find fb10 which is very economical"
5,Always lagging
3,
2,"There is a problem when signing up, I can't make an account since the system keeps on asking for stronger password. I even combined all possible letter, number and symbol combinations but it's not working. Then how can I enjoy the Giga Points if I can't make an account. Please fix the app and I may change the ratings to 5-star. Looking forward for the update. Thanks"

I haven't signed up my second number to this app but it says that my second number is already been signed up. Please check the problem. The app itself is good since it's more convenient so please fix it.
2,"The application was great, however, still the data connection was sooooooo sluggish. I hope the management will include to upgrade their cell sites and hope to improve the data connection in regional but huc city."

1,Only the GigaPoints are the only useful things on this app
5,
1,"I registered on this app before and was working okay. But i uninstalled it. After re- installing it again and tried to log in, it says my phone number is not registered. And when im trying to register, my phone number becomes invalid. What the heck! How can it be invalid if i can register on their giga promos by dialling *123#. This is crazy!"
1,"I can't even sign up,. Inappropriate number?? Seriously?? Choose stronger password?? What kind of password do you want????????"
4,
5,
1,Its convenient for balance inquiry but it also inconvenient for not having an auto log in feature it keeps me putting my credentials on the log in screen. I hope this may identify and solve this problem
5,
5,
1,I can't even sign up with my number it says use strong password but i believe that I've use strong enough password but it always says use strong password even though i use so many strong password but at the end I can't sign up pls fix this

5,Good application
5,
4,Good for connecting people.
5,
5,Its good
1,Still don't have a good promotion. Your P50 will still give you 1GB and another 1GB daily for some apps for 3 days. Will you go bankrupt if you'll just make it 4GB data for 3 days for any apps or website? If GLOBE can do it so can you. Switching to GLOBE once my promotion ends and currently selling my PLDT wifi to buy GLOBE wifi.
5,Great
5,It ok
5,
1,"I've tried to sign up so many times but it keeps saying ""not a valid number"" even though it's clearly my smart phone number I keep typing it many times and it still says the same can you tell me what's going on and why? yes I've checked my number again and again I even tried to copy and paste it and re typing it again."

1,Cant open USAGE !!!!
1,SMART THEFT this mybe a new way to know how much they stole from you.
2,This happen to me and my sister. I registered to Giga stories 50 and im using the fb alone to scroll and watch video. Then shock me that my SHAREABLE is being consumed instead of my STORIES. Like literally i checked the usage sa app but the shareable consumed was around 100+ but gosh i did not even go somewhere or some sites. I dont know what happen here but u guys may check your balance from time 2 time it might be ur shareable is being consumed instead of stories.
3,
1,Un install
5,Excellent apps 👍👌💪
5,nice
5,goog
1,Where to find fb10 in the app
1,"If I could give no star for this app I'd do it. Worst app I've encountered. When I tried to open the app its just blinking white screen, not even loading or whatsoever. I tried to uninstall and install again multiple times but nothing happened."
5,
1,"Useless puro antataas ng presyo ng load ala ung mga pang low level. And those ""stories"" ""videos"" and ""games"" additional load is useless too because the shareable load is always consumed first even when you only play a game or access a site that is included on the promo."
3,
1,
4,A very helpful app
5,
5,Nice
5,

5,Ok
5,
5,
1,Worst..signing up always asking for stronger password..cant sign up
3,5 star sana Kaso nawala yung magreregister ka ng fb10 or ML10 dati naman meron pero nung nagupdate wala na. Kindly fix this issue ASAP
5,
1,Logging in is such a hassle
3,
1,"Beyond this app, the service you can buy at minimum is 199 which is very limiting (where is the 50 pesos worth?). The sharable data is also misleading, e.g. games won't connect unless you register to a giga games promo. And lastly, if not most of the time, the connection speed is throttled. Side by side with a smart infinity user, us prepaid users were getting disconnected on zoom intermittently... And so, at the heart of your corporate decision, this is common tao sabotage. 😔"
5,TNT at SMART AKO!!!
1,"NEW UPDATE: I was able to sign up. But loading takes a long time. Really long time. (My internet is ok) I still cannot access details . UPDATE: Did as told, uninstalled and installed, etc. Still says my number is invalid. Says my number is invalid. Tried quick view and error prompt messages popped one after another without me clicking on anything. :("
5,

1,so poor
5,

1,i cant sign up
1,Poor signal. Kbps only?

4,
2,Can't use it when it needs an update
4,
3,
1,Low
5,
5,
5,
1,I installed this app because i can register fast with it But your mb will drain more faster 6gb to 1.45gb in 20 mins and now i will delete it..😡😡
1,"For starters, the app is good and easy to use but for some reason it doesn't work for me anymore, slow refresh rate to know your data consumption or remaining data balance to prevent overspending and the giga points you earned from the past is gone after a day or two receiving, and much more it's more accurate to request a text message for your promo remaining balance."
1,kinginang password yan. bwesit
5,
3,
5,🤗
5,Very convenient to use good job smart
5,I love you all and keep updating

1,"Bakit po laging loading Ang app na to. naka abot na ako nang minimum points, gusto ko sanang e avail . Naka ilang attempt na ako ganun parin. Laging service unavailable!......😤"
5,
3,"I can't even sign up it just keeps saying ""please choose a stronger password"" fix this ffs. Edit: ok it worked but does it really have to be like how you did it? I've tried passwords that were probably stronger than: (My name).12345"
5,
5,already received the crates it took 13 hours to be sent im good now thought i was scammed just late
3,"Why Didn't you include the Giga Games, in reedem points,,,, my points it's such a waste in GiGa Video's"
5,
4,
1,It's too difficult to create a strong password I tried so many times but still not accepted
4,Edited my review from 1 star i am giving 4 stars only bcoz its so annoying you need to log in every time you check ur data usage thank you the real time OTP now
1,The problem with this is that it keeps updating every time. And you can't use it unless you update it to the latest version. So then you can't use the app to register for a data promo to update the app. Useless.
4,"Overall, this app is good to use, makes tracking data consumption easier, but one thing, maybe if you could add points to those who are loading through sari sari stores and not just from buying load from the app. 🙂 waiting for more updates"
5,Awesome
2,"I'm trying to log in to your app to register for an internet promo, however it gives me an error to check my internet connection.. How do you think I can connect to the internet when I'm supposed to register to your app? It's crazy you know... I have enough load to register to a promo but I can't register because I can't log in to your app... Frustrating.."
5,If you read this iloveyou and if you using giga life give them 5 starts because they do what they can to improve the app thank you

Parang sa other network po may points na natatanggap pag nagload, hindi ko na po ito pahahabain pa.. Thank you and God Bless po 😇😊😊🥰🥰"

1,"Nagload ako kahapon tas ginamit ko itong giga app tas ngayon dko n magamit eh for 7days ung pinili ko giga stories bakit ganun saka hndi rin ako maka log in,this app is a scam iload and subscribe to giga stories yesterday but now icant use it anymore it suppose to be a 7days usage but now icant use it"
1,Not working
1,"Okay at first use. Next sign-in, it takes forever to load the app. It's just stuck on empty ""cards."""
1,Because this app will not directly give you feedback that you already registered. Sayang 3 bisis akong nag send ng request di ko na tanggap agad ang confirmation tapos di ko lang alam na mai charge na pala sa bawat request ko. Imbis na 200 pesos lang sana ang gamitin ko nag bayad ako ng 600 puta.
1,Slow and crashing app...it's better if you still allow the *123# to function until this app is fixed...I know your trying to get people use this app to upgrade but is useless if the app itself is full of holes...if you want this app to prosper try fixing its problems and use beta testing if it solved the problem...I would sign up as a beta tester if a fixed beta app is available
2,Im stuck in loading screen
5,
1,The app takes so much to load even with fast internet.
3,I installed the APP but couldn't use it because it wouldn't load the card? The message I get is CARD IS STILL LOADING PLS WAIT. I waited over an hour but it still won't load. What to do???
2,I can't log in
5,Good

2,"I can't sign up. Even though I've done what is required in the password, it always says that I should use a stronger password. My supposed password is longer than 8 characters, letters and symbols but the app won't accept it. :( I really wanted to create an account here because it looks like it's easy to use so I hope you can fix this issue, thank you!

5,Maganda sana eh maraming promos pero nakakainis kasi pag mag reregister ako lagi nalang ako nag lolog in di na sasave nakaka hassle kung nagmamadali ako tapos kailangan pa ng internet connection para magamit yung app. Kaya nga ako mag reregister kasi wala na akong load eh. Hindi ito convinient mas lalo pa akong na hassle
3,"I just installed the app pero bakit wala yung Giga K-video sa menu? Even sa *123#, it is not showing up. Edit: I am using the Smart Bro Prepaid"
5,
4,"Edited: Tried different ways to sign up but it say's you have to use a stronger password. So annoying, what's the use??? Finally registered. Tried doing the same thing with the password you've given but it did'nt work. This is what worked. Example: Dvahsbdu9 Using a big letter in the beginning, small letters in the middle and a number in the end. Voila!"
1,ka arte sa paggawa ng password. pingahalo ko na mga letter symbol at number ayaw parin. kaka asar..
1,Sana hindi na kailangan ng internet para mag register/subscribe ulit sa promo
1,I can't sign up..it says need stronger password? So..I randomly spam letters to be my password and again it says..need stronger password Really?my password is random and I spam it..why I can't log in

5,
2,Not sure
2,"Okay, Smart. We get that your network is the leading, ""fastest"" in providing network and service. But this app sucks in terms of convenience. Like do we have to necessarily update it everytime there's available? Couldn't we just use it and update it whenever and wherever we like to? This is so annoying considering your pricing doesn't equate to the services you offer 🙄"
3,Sometimes it says unparseable date The I can't open my account 😑 It said error ####

3,Ganda kumpara sa mga Globe apps. Very useful din. Kabwisit lang yung GIGA promo. Bakit di na lang OPEN-ACCESS DATA na lang lahat kagaya ng GO Promo ng Globe. Daming gimik... Saka bakit kailangan kong maglogin palagi? Sana e-enter na lang yung PIN kada open ng app....
5,Its nice! Thats all
1,"When I register and I put password it's say "" create a strong password""I make different password and it's the same"

And when I get a new load this apo won't let me app. I don't know tho but this had happen yesterday (Nov 24) when I called someone from the customer care service saying that had been updating something. Plss fix the app. Also the depletion of the data had been abruptly fast....whyyyyyy.
1,"The app is good but when I sign up it always said ""please choose a strong password"""
1,"1/4 star..Very expensive! Data is super expensive and very tricky,cheapest is P50 they used to have P30. Guys people are struggling these days..in other countries if you pay for a data it really means you will really use all of that data..it doesn't matter if you only use it for facebook or just browsing or youtube and doesnt expire in a number of days unlike your giga thing that expires in a number of days.. So dont you ask me why i said expensive because it really is"
1,"Why cant i log in. The reply is always try again after a few minutes. Then when i enter my password, the reply is your entered incorect password,. How come? Its disgusting. Yuor offering this app for better and easier way but it turn out worst. Sorry but it really is disgusting."
5,
5,
1,Di ko maintindihan kung paano magreregister ulit sa giga life app n'yo kung di naman na pala gumagana kapag ubos na ang open access data. Paano? Tapos kapag ubos na yung open access data di na din gumagana yung 1gb araw araw na promo n'yo.

1,"Please release an UPDATE in SHOWING ALL YOUR PROMO Why is it, i only saw GIGA PRO ONLY, what about the registration to an ordinary GIGA promo The app is good, however some of the giga promo they offer CAN NOT BE REGISTER. Like giga work if its not on your favorite list, you can not register in it thru the app. FOR IMPROVEMENT, ADD SELECTION MODE FOR ALL THE PROMO that the smart offer. Do not show only the favorite/usual promo that the user used."
5,Ok
1,
2,I change the rate because still disappointed on your service. Still eating on data using only the extra. Also if I dont have a load and open the data the gigalife app won't open. No choice so I use the *123# method instead on your app.

5,Nice apps 👌 thanks Smart Communication
5,"I rate it 5 star because it helps me a lot easily. Knowing that you can check your data usage and other promos. Especially smart app promos is the best and diferrent from others. Also the promos on the *123# is different from the smart app, because the smartbapp has a lot of surprises to see. Even though the fact that I cannot use it without a wifi/data, but I believe that smart app will improve their app. Still its a 5 star for me. And also I highly recommend the app for everyone."

1,"I am currently subscribed to giga video 99 and while i'm watching youtube the SHAREABLE DATA is being consumed not the VIDEO EVERYDAY DATA please review your service, I use that shareable data for my studies. Note my hotspot is not open so no one is using the promo aside from me. Gonna rate 1 star for now because I am very disappointed with this matter."

1,Hang up hard to navigate
4,Now I can login ... It takes some time though to choose a strong password but ones you login you get a 100 mb for free and 10 points which is good and you can get some promos .
1,Useless app. I hope there is 0 star rating for this crapplication
4,
5,This is my first time ever I used this apps so I have nothing to say against this apps now

5,
5,
5,Wow
4,"For now, I'll give a 4, since the app seems like it's not totally complete. And about the updates other users consider as an issue, as far as I remember since I installed this app, they always give a free 100mb for you to update/install the app, and the app is less than 50mb. The only thing I need to emphasize is that whenever my data allocation goes to less than 50mb, it's quite difficult to use it. It goes like from 5mbps to 50kbps. Other than that, it's good."
5,
5,Good app

5,"Compared to the other Smart account apps, this one *finally* feels polished and modern. There are bugs every now and then, but nothing that a restart/clear cache can't fix. Oh, and it would be good if can access ALL my transaction history and not just my recent ones."
1,Useless app.I cant log in unless i have an internet connection.So i register using *123#.What is the purpose of this app?Tskk.The fact that you hired bigtime endorsers but cant even provide an useful app.
5,"This is a good app,try it"
1,"no Response from a rep yesterday 9:00am from Fb messenger, never put on description that typically response within a day if no one can respond with 24 hrs."

3,
3,"I need to know why you remove the SUPRIZE in *123#. I use to always buy the 299 promo but now it's gone. Also, Instead of having 1gb a day for Games, or Video , or Stories, can you just give 1gb shareable data a day? And remove the original shareable data instead. Or maybe add GIGA Download where you can use it download in Chrome or inside game? It would be useful."

5,"This is cool you can see how much your load balance and sometimes you receive a promo I didn't delete it I like this. You can see when you open this application so many you can choose a giga like games, video, stories, study, work, and more giga. And you can earn a points to make more load balance I think every month this application have a update every update you can see they have promo or load balance.

3,
1,Its not convenient to use. The account and password needed needs to be in paragraph form before accepting that your password is strong. The heck wasting time. The developer of this app must go to jail and needs enhancement hayst.

Strictly limiting me to 100 MB a day. And my GIGAVIDEO99 daily 1Gb and 2 gig ""shareable data"" almost drains like a dam. A piece of advice. Do not use this app."
5,
1,Bakit nawala ung Other promos sa TNT mahirap lang po ako tapos puro giga lang offer niyo stupid!!!
5,"The app helps me a lot whenever i want to keep track of my promo data allocation and when it will expired. I want to suggest a additional or update promo for giga games. If it is possible, kindly please add data allocation for the game Genshin Impact in Giga Games promo. So we will be able to play it whenever we go without thinking much about data cost it will consume."

1,"Can't even create an account. It says try a stronger password. I tried putting a combination of letters, numbers, and symbol. But it's not accepted. Very inconvenient. What kind of password you are looking? I almost made a sentence with my password. Not user friendly."

1,"App is fine but SMART GIGA K-Video subscription is a joke. Why saying it gives us VIU Premium if its really not? Been weeks since I subscribed to that promo but haven't got into that VIU Premium. Its just keeps on loading.. loading and loading. Please, alisin nyo nalang po yung sinasabi nyong FREE Premium kung wala naman po talaga. Kasi po, marami po kayong pinapaasa. SMART will be branded as ""sinungaling"" if you keep that ads saying that it has."
2,"I mean it is useful if I wanna register the giga promos and still it loads so slow even takes 5 minutes. But I hope they could just put all the promo of smart, tnt, and even sun.. I would give this a 5 star if that happens."

1,I can't register any promos like GIGA VIDEO when i tap the buy giga video it will crash plsss fix this
5,
5,Great
1,"Very slow in sending code, smart send the code after 7 minutes so you can not use the code anymore because five minutes is only allowed for you to access this app."
5,
3,The updated App seems to be weaker than the previous one. What happened? By the way I have 2 Smart prepaid (I stopped the postpaid after the lapse of its 2-year contract) numbers and 3 Globe numbers (including a prepaid given by Grab for its Grab Car operators). I was loyal to Smart Giga99 for almost 2 years. Then my drivers told me that Globe has a better offer. Like GOSAKTO140. Last June 30 Globe launched Go140 with 11 Gig consumable. Can Smart offer similar 11 Gig for P140? Thanks.

5,
2,it took to much time to load the details and I have to log in again once closed.

2,"Tried to download the app because I can't subscribe to any promos using the *121#, but after using the app and choosing a promo it keeps saying something went wrong/timeout and returns me to the main page.. What is the problem with the app and the usual *121# where I can subscribe to your promos?"
5,
1,Not working
5,I love this app..hope for the next update it would notify me
5,The app is nice to me
1,Not responding
1,When playing ML we players experience crashing of the game. And the higher the load you have the more lag you experience. Example 10load are lag but 50load are more lag and crashing can't even download videos in youtube but I think the signal is only poor in our place but fixed that issue to give you 5 star .
5,This app helped me a lot. It lets you know the expiration date of the selected bundle. It is really helpful. I recommend this app for smart users.
1,"Your app is not working at all,,how many times I tried to process renewing my existing gb plan it's not really cooperating waste of storage to download this app so disappointed 😡😒"
1,"Smart app? Pede sana kung ma aaccess yan offline para maka register, nung nagsimula maglaunch tong app biglang d na ako makaregister sa *123# naka ilang beses na ako mga 10 at wala parin akong makuhang confirmation sa niregister ko. Access through Internet connection? kung wala edi, d ako makakaconnect kasabay pa ng pagloloko ng *123#. pano na?"
5,good
5,Great job smart...
5,
4,So far i found it very useful.
1,There is no added feature for this app and it will only consume data when you use it. There is no interesting thing to enjoy with this app. I can still view and register at *123# with ease.
1,May pa app app pa kaung ganian. Tangina nio bulok. Mahal na nga load wala pang kwenta smart dito sa mindoro. Tapon nio na signal dito. Kaya hirap pilipinas sa signal ea. Online class pa nalalaman bubulok ng mga signal
5,
4,Hope there is also a points reward acquired every time we buy our pre paid load and the points collected can be used for surfing or texting /calling. Many people have been using Smart for the past twenty years and I think we deserve loyalty points too.
1,walamg kwenta paanu magagamit pldt n yan bwesit
5,
2,why it can't continue?
1,"1 star for me your internet services in cebu provinces is really slow, unlike the other Philippines area have good signals by the way. Manila has best signal mean while here in cebu having difficulty of having acces of social media please fix this kind of issue whe are paying for internet we should have rights to have stable network connection too. Kind of unfair."
5,
5,
1,Kahit gano kaganda promo wala din kwenta sa sobrang bagal ng internet connection!
1,"MySmart, MyPLDT and *121# is Better. Can only see one number/account at a time? MySmart and MyPLDT can list all my accounts without asking for OTP every sign in."
5,
5,
5,Ok
5,
3,
5,Nice
5,Very faster
1,"The interface is somehow great. Pero hindi real time ung data usage sa app. It's still better to utilize *143#, for at least I'm sure that my data usage is prompt accordingly."
5,Editing my review.. Great app. Shows your balance and promos you can avail. It will be great if you can add all promos available in *123#.
1,
5,
5,
1,"i am currently subscribed to 7 day game time, this app tells me i am not subscribed to any promo. restarted the app still the same still no subscribed to any promo. everytime you open the app you need to input your number and requires a pin everytime, why is that?"
5,Noice
5,
4,
4,Ey Smart!! I guess your network now is doing well now!! So i like it again... But its still lagging sometimes. But now its ok. COMMENT ME!!!

5,
5,👌
5,"very informative, updated, intertaining"
5,
5,
2,Not much of a use for me. Offers available at 123# are not all accessible. Limited to giga videos and stories. How about for unli calls?
5,
3,Easy and affordable app
5,"Good App at laking tulong para sa akin itong New Smart app na ito, Salamat kasi sinama na din niyo dito sa app na ito ang katulad kong TNT subscriber ! Keep improving ! 🙂👍 ... Thumbs UP !"

1,Needs more improvement. PIN is for the security of the user but why i always get a pin everytime i open the app. It is more convenient to use the *123# than the app.
4,Ok
4,Its repeating again and again can't it save the the number you have enter last time and when i was asking for another pin it didn't send me a pin
3,Yes it help..But then it needs internet. Why would I use my data if I can check my balance for free without wasting it. Im just practical . 3 star for it.
5,
5,Good
1,"The app says I have no subscriptions but I'm registered to GIGA promo. Then checking the usage section, the data shown is not updated real-time."

2,"Right now this is just too much hassle to use. I downloaded this cause i have two smart sims so I thought this could help me easily access them both. But too bad for me, cause it can only register one sim at a time which is really a disappointment. With this mush hassle I could've just use the *121# atleast that could access any account without asking for OTP every time. Also the app don't even have a Pasaload feature. 🙄🙄"

2,"Got a problem, just recently.... my load of unlicall and text was ok but I can't make a call. Smart pls fix."
4,
5,
5,
4,"I like this app because it allows me to keep track on my data usage. Suggestion I would have is to also include other plans (like Sakto, Combo, UCT, etc) on the suggested plans available. This will surely make it easier for people who just want to purchase limited and budget plans."
5,

4,Excellent
2,"Could have been better if they have like description when you click the icon instead of multiple clicks just to get the description. I like paymaya better when buying load or promos, the promo name is listed and the small description is at the lower part so you dont have to click multiple times to see what the promotion is."
1,What's wrong with the old My Smart app?
5,Great
5,

4,

5,
5,
5,Very good
4,"I understand it's in beta but it works well overall.... But options are still lacking. One thing for example... About the ""Stories promo"".... There is NO EXTEND option in this app, whereas there is, in the *123# option in the dialer.... Where I would resort to in the end of the day. I would love to see this as an ALL IN ONE app in the future. Keep developing your services. In the meantime I would give only 4 stars."
5,
5,Amazing....
5,
5,
5,

2,"So, this app is not usable by Postpaid users. We're stuck with the old one, so is that still being maintained? What about the myPLDT Smart app? What's that one for now? In general, my rant/advice is stop making multiple FRAGMENTED apps."
5,
4,
1,"Worthless. Hangs on 1st use, uninstalled."
5,Amazing
2,Not a good idea for those oldies who don't use android phones and still use keypad phones. How can they inquire for their balances?
2,
2,"Bad signal in our area. The maximum signal have here js at 2 bars. Please improve Smart. this is Metro Manila, I'm not at the province or something."
1,Impresive
5,
4,I'm glad to see that changes were made. I can now see plans subscribed and expiration date. Would still like to know subscription start date though.
3,"It would be better if all the promos on *121# function is available on the application, Aside from that everything's good 👍"
5,Easy to use
1,
3,You have expensive promos and low allotted data for each promo.
5,
5,
5,
5,
5,
4,
3,"As I dial the *123#, there is a new menu which is the surprise. I click then and choose the giga stories to subscribe. This offer tells that I'll get 1gb for stories everyday and 2gb for 7 days plus extra 1gb everyday but as soon as I received the confirmation text, It tells that I just have 1gb stories everyday and 2gb for 7days. There is no plus 1gb everyday. Can you be more accurate to your promo offer?"
4,
2,Walang laman
5,
5,fast transaction using this app 👍

3,Maybe Is good.but sometimes Is not good
5,
1,Bad app. Everytime I open. Always asking for OTP. one time pin is one one time not every open.

5,Awesome
5,
3,have just downloaded the app and yet to try and have my first experience on this
2,Your data connection is so bad i cant even open your own app
3,"This beta is fine, just needs to be more user friendly with the login and the app interface. You have to do some few taps to see every promo and data you have where you can just see all of it in one screen it can be frustrating in some times, and the female model is taking 1/3rd of the screen, we just need the full details in one screen and remove unnecessary details for more convenience. I hope this could be improved in future updates."

5,Good
5,

3,I know it's still in beta but this needs a lot of work. You have to type in your number each time and enter the one time pin each time. The information is slow to load (it can take up to a minute for your balance to show) and you can only view one number at a time. Why not devote the resources to improving and fixing the bugs on the existing mypldt app? This is useless if you have multiple sims you need to load and manage promos for.

1,Always asking your phone number before you can use the app is very very annoying esp. to those peoples who cant memorize their phone numbers. I understand because this is beta version app but zero star for me

2,Half baked app with copy paste promos and half baled promos. Most of the promos that are currently displayed here are expensive and TBH many people with the right mind don't want to spend too much on some load. There are still so many promos that aren't even available including the ones that were perfectly balanced.
5,Lady
1,Why can't we use the app everytime you release an update??? I am using a pocket wifi and registers promo thru the app. It's very inconvenient.

5,good
2,Where using prepaid pocket wifi & SURFMAX 50 everyday. But now we cant do that. What option we can use for our pocket wifi? As of july 14 your promo SURFMAX is already unavailable.

3,"I like the app, the feature of showing you the remaining balance of your load is great. You can also buy promos instantly. What I'm a bit disappointed to is, everytime I open the app, I always had to input my phone number and it takes about 3 seconds or so. I hope they make an update that when you open the app, they just need a 1-time pin."

1,What an absolute waste of downlaod space and time. I cannot even login. It asks for my cp mumber then all i get is java error and the screen jumping. What makes it more annoying is the fact this stupid java error message stays on my screen even when i turn data conection off. I have to turn my phone on and off you get rid of it. for a telecomunications company. Its pathetic
5,
5,
5,Nice
3,"Since I want to be polite, I won't say that this pathetic excuse of a beta app destroyed my day. I'd rather say that you can't access the promos section if you're not connected to a WiFi or having open access data yet. That supports the fact that a subscriber with no internet connection can't register promos via smart app. It only shows remaining load balance and your SIM information. I'm forced to renew my GIGA GAMES 299 to GET extra 4GB. I want GIGA VIDEO 299 tho..."

Would update my star after it was fixed.

I think Smart must take a closer look at this concern.."

4,"Your recent promo is a little bit misleading and it got me confused, you should put more detail on the future promos so that people will know what the promo is all about. The thing is, the promo said that I will receive 2x data on my ""open data access"", and I thought that the 2x data will be added/multiplied to my shareable data, but instead, it went to the GIGA subscription (GIGA Video data, to be exact) that I'm subscribed to."
3,
1,Maayos pero sana may Loyalty Points ang dali kasing mauubos data eh tas minsan wala pang signal. Sana lagyan nila ng Loyalty Points at kahit papaano hindi ma bad trip customer nila. Another problem nanamn they said when i register sa any giga promo it will become double now i where's the double gig data that youre saying. Lilipat nalang ata ako sa Ibang network dahil sa kalokohan nyo.

1,Worst app! On the Other promos-allnet -there's have no promos
3,"This one is okay,but WHY DOES IT NEED TO BE UPDATED FREQUENTLY?"
1,Not working. Useless.
3,"The app is ok but i register with the giga suprise that suppose to give me an extra 1GB/day is not working, it keeps draining my shareable data. Can you please do something about it"
2,good app but the promo that i picked its not working ! hope to fix that

1,What a scam promo You said double the Data but you only add it in free Daily Video in GIGA surf what hell is that you trick us we expect that the sharerable data will double or our data will double but that data end up in video streaming data for example the gigsurf have free daily 1GB video streaming everyday ..the double data you said is end up join the free daily data and consume all if you stream like youtube what a click bait to download your apps fooling person for your personal intrst

1,
5,
5,
5,Very good
5,Love it
3,The smart app is very useful. You cam find the promo best for your life style and its very user friendly. The reason why i only gave it 3 star is because the app is only useful if u have an existing data subscription. Once your subscription expires then there's no way for you to access the smart app. Only option left is to go to your nearest loading station and get ur subscription renewed. If that is case then the smart app will only be used to check ur balance which u can do by dialing *123#. And the 2nd thing is why do we have to type in my mobile number everytime i try to use the smart app ? Is that an option if in case someone want to use my phone to check their balance ? It would be nice if u guys can have it like auto save the mobile number. Ill change my star rating once you guys gets all the issue fix. For now ill just leave the app on my phone and just continue using *123#

1,Such a waste of time
2,1. Doesn't save phone #. I have to keep entering # then enter OTP. It's annoying. 2. Few and repetitive offers. 3. Offers are expensive compare to other network. I can get 5 gb for 50 and yours just what? 1 gb or 2? 4. There's nothing much to it. The app is very plain.
5,i need more experience

3,It is not bugging anymore but needs more information when it comes to your subscriptions.
5,
4,
5,Good
5,
5,
3,There is no option for Gametime 100 or 50 on Other Promos. Please fix it. Same to the promos shown when dialing *123#

5,
4,"The new update is good. You can now easily navigate through the app. The reason I gave this app a 4star rating because I think it is useless when you don't have an existing data subscription I suggest that this app will be accessible even though you don't have data and add some features like, you can add load using an e-wallet so that users can save the trouble of going out."

1,"Ang demanding ng app na ito, gusto sa SIM 1 pa. What's the diff kung parehong 4G enabled ang SIM slot? Ang mahal pa ng mga subscription. No way. App Uninstalled and will not recommend to friends. It works on both sim slot. Anyways, wala pa rin kwenta. The app don't remember your number. You need to log in and enter OTP everytime na gagamitin mo itong app. Wala talagang kwenta ang Smart. Napakatagal din dumating ng OTP. 👎👎👎👎👎"
1,Ayusin niyo muna yung network niyo ..hindi yung nagpapayaman lang

5,
5,
5,easy
5,Helpful
5,You can access your smart account even if the sim is not inserted in your phone (e.g. pocket wifi). It eliminates the need to remove the sim from the device and transfer it to a phone to subscribe for a data promo. This is very useful to me especially during this time when I am working from home and pocket wifi is all I can afford. I love this app.
4,
5,i love it
1,Ang bagal ng network nyo..... Sayang load ko!!!!!!
5,
5,
5,very good

1,
5,The GUI is smooth and appealing + the way you let us be able to choose promos and check our subscription status are great. UPDATE: You guys actually listened and added the 'Add Load' feature!!! Thank you!! It made it easier for me to load as I used to go to your website to load my phone.

1,Deleting comment eh? Ayosin nyo network nyo Yung balance bat need ng mobile data para makita? Anu yan load muna bago makita? Panu kung may mag send ng load tas nak of notif bat i on pa data para makita? Di naman makikita ang load pag ganito kasi required naman Buti pa dial *123# nalang
5,
4,Could have been better. Why does it need to ask for the number everytime I open the app and put in the OTP. It defeats the purpose of the One-Time-Password.
1,Napakawalang kwentang app grabe di ko mapakinabangan ayaw magprocceed. Nacheck ko na ang aggreement hanggang dun lang ayaw magnext. Di ako mahilig magrate ng mababa pero sa panahon na sobra kong kailangan di ko magamit nakakainis. At ilang beses na ako nagtry. At kailangan ko sana para mapadali trabaho ko nagpapatagal pa to.

1,How need this apps to runing my device
3,Sends SMS to download App on my postpaid SIM and when you open it says for prepaid subscribers only. You like us to download this App and spend what little mobile data we have for nothing? You can only use this for prepaid so I buy an prepaid SIM so that I can use this app
1,1 star because globe one app is still better. Smart app is nice but globe has the best offer for now. I hope you can upgrade your promos many online student and online worker will appreciate it. Hoping there will be a progress i know smart can do it better

Today with the update, it will ask you from time to time to enter an OTP. it is quite annoying coz it is going to ask for the OTP everytime you use the app. I dunno but i think i will have to uninstall it."

2,"Exclusive promos such us Double Data when you register through the is not awarded automatically after you register. Although the interface is easy to use, the promos for data are always not economical and they have removed Unlitext from Giga promos which is also a negative factor."
4,The app is promising but it lacks self update. It could've been better if we have an option to update app through the app itself.

1,"The App is ok so far. My problem is that when I registered to GIGAVIDEO 299 when it was a HOT OFFER from the app (you get twice the open access data and VIDEO EVERYDAY allocation), the only data group that was being consumed is the FREE DATA from the HOT OFFER, even when I was only streaming YOUTUBE. I'm not sure though if this is related to the app itself or there was a mistake in SMART's data consumption heirarchy. It makes very little sense that you double the allocation for VIDEO EVERYDAY but the open access data gets consumed instead of the allocation for video. I brought this promo mainly for watching YOUTUBE so this is such a bummer unless it gets fixed and the data that was mistakenly deducted from my free open access is swapped with VIDEO EVERYDAY allocation. I am hoping for your quick and positive response. 1-star for now until this issue is fixed and confirmed not related to the app. UPDATE: The app now won't work properly on my phone. Uninstalled and reinstalled again to see if it fixes it. It works fine for about a few uses and then returns to not logging in properly and asking the OTP again even though I just dialed it in. Also, SMART's customer service agents wer not able to assist me with this issue. Nothing changes even when I try to ask for help from SMART. Typical~. If I am only able to give this app less than 1 start, I would."

What I only care is to be able to use your app even if it NOT UPDATED! I CAN UPDATE ANYTIME I WANT. AND PLEASE PUT A FUNCTION TO CLOSE YOUR APP WHEN I TAP THE BACK BUTTON INSTEAD OF FORCING US TO TAP HOME! 😡😡😡😡

1,Pangit ng promo nyo nagpromo pa kayo tipid sa data sayang lang niload ko sobrang lag ang ml sa giga games ayusin nyo naman nagbabayad nman kami ng tama!
5,"""i can't sign up, it won't accept my password."" the response was very fast. thank you for the help and the response was well instructed. i can sign up now. thank you."
1,
5,Very good
2,"Hung up. Kept requesting to update . And it kept reverting to same request Re your suggestion to restart, no not yet. But I reinstalled it and the same problem, exactly.. Ok I restarted and updated. It's working fine now as before. Thank you. 2 Nov 2020, It's extremely stressful when the app is offline or blank everytime I need information, rendering it useless. I'm still giving it a 2 stars, the extra star because you relocated the woman's pic, a cheap marketing tool."
3,"Thanks for the improvements, but load amount spent on new promo subscription doesn't automatically update. Still need to go to home screen just to confirm if load paid is already debited."
4,
1,"Even signing up is a hassle. The OTP doesn't even get sent. I don't even receive any even after lots of tries. I also loaded my account(not sure if you can call it that since I wasn't even able to register), but when I try to avail some promos, it says that I don't have enough balance even though it reflects that I do. All in all, a very useless app. Just adds stress. Just surf the net for promos and register on your own. You can also manually check your data balance anyway."
5,Does this supports Sun?
2,"I cant make an account, no matter how long the password i put, it says that i should use a stronger one."

1,"Useless app created by smart can't even log in,,"
1,why ML 10 does not see in this App
1,There's login functionality but no remember me? It's kinda pain in the a** to relogin everytime. How hard it is to put remember me on the app or just put PIN like any others apps? You're a multi million peso company. You could do better.

4,"It's good you can easily redeem your rewards and loading promo but there's something missing in GigaStudy the Chrome you need to add Chrome so you can go to the site of the link for studies you can download files,etc for studies."
1,"I'm so disappointed. I tried to sign up because I'm new here and the password sucks! It ALWAYS asks me to have a stronger password, and I tried every password that has letters, numbers and symbols and still it doesn't work :( Maybe, I'll stick to *123#"
2,"So frustrating. I cant even sign up coz of password issues. It says to choose a stronger password with letter, number and character combinations. I came up with several and it didnt accept it!!"

4,
5,
1,The apps sucks. After uninstalling and installing a couple of times theres still no way for me to check my usage. Called customer hotline .. talked to tech team and still issue was not resolved. Uninstalling the app and will use the 9999 option. Much easier
1,I could never get it to work..
1,Still not Working 🙂
3,Okay naman yung app kaso mas okay sana kung magkaron ng feature na Pasaload o kaya pasadata kasi madaming gumagamit ng smart/tnt hindi alam magpasa ng load/data
1,"Bakit bawal na ang magpa-load ng bro postpaid add-ons gamit ang text/tawag? Walang net para mag-download ng GigaLife app; May deadline kagabi at ngayong umaga =/ Text-tawag pa rin naman ang primary means of contact (or in this case, sa pagpa-load); Out-of-touch ba sa community ang nagpasimuno nitong GigaLife-app-only-for-load? Gumamit ako ng Globe wifi para ma-download ang Smart GigaLife app. Kita niyo ba ang irony? Magpapaayos na rin ako ng Globe nano SIM para makapaglipat na sa Globe prepaid"

1,It keeps telling me to make a stronger password even though i already did. So stupid
3,"For now I will give you 3star, its very nice and easy to used and to know the promo. Though I have noticed that there's a promo when you dial *121# that it doesn't show in gigalife app. And the top of my concern is why TNT signal its gone or no service. I shift in TNT because it too fast here in our area and then now its hard for me to join in a google meeting."
3,
5,The best way and fastest way to register on your favorite promos. I have been using this and I don't have a much problem of it. And thanks for the freebies. Recommended app for Smart and TnT users👍🏻

1,"Smart's GigaLife doesn't offer ANY data load or promo that simply allows data usage as you see fit. Instead, you are FORCED to pay for video or ""stories"" or study or work or games packages that you may or may not want. Why not all, or none, of the above? They offer packages geared toward their partners, not their customers. I want unencumbered Internet access. The Internet is diverse: I don't want to be boxed in or forced to waste money on ""specials"" I don't need. At minimum, Smart should offer a simple, straight, data load along with their other offerings. But it appears that's the LAST thing they want to do. It's about what they want: not what we want. Isn't this unresponsiveness exactly why Philippine telecom companies have been threatened with expropriation by the government? Time to text 8888 Citizen's Complaint Center."
5,
5,Updating. Why does it need to update before you can use it? What if you don't have a data or a wifi? How will you can use it? And the giga points. How to redeem it or how will you can use it? What is the use of that points? Explain about that thing?
1,
5,
1,I hate this app cause it keeps saying choose a stonger password even my password is 23 words
5,

5,
4,
5,
1,Why can't I see my loading history even before I installed the app? Such waste not able to view you personal transaction history and might be a violation to data privacy don't you think?
4,"Overall, this app is actually good especially that I am able to control my usage of the mobile data, and it's really helpful with my online classes as I register it to Giga Study promo. I am giving you 4 stars for now because I'd like to request for Quipper to be added on the Giga Study promo. Many of us, users, would surely love it more the moment you decide to cater Quipper on one of your promos. Thank you!"
4,
3,
2,2 stars for now. Ever since the update I can't find the option to load up the promo that I want. Now I have the trouble of removing the simcard of my prepaid wifi and insert it to phone just to register for the promo that I wanted which is a hassle. Hope that they can improve this app.
1,Trash
5,
5,
2,"I have some giga points and tried to use it but it doesnt work on me. I suggest that you also put the access on giga points ""thing"" through the *121# coz thats really convinient and much more accessible rather than this app. Its waste some space and time. Needs to be improved. Still more power and blessing, hoping that you read this. Thank you😊"

2,"This app works with quickview but after registering and logging in, the app would stay at perpetual loading mode. I have -uninstalled and reinstalled the app. -restarted my phone. -logged out then in -connected via mobile data instead of wifi. Nothing works. It is very disappointing. I sent a message to smart so hoping they will fix it but they seem to currently be misunderstanding my messages."
4,Nice apps I can easily check my balance..... But I wish you gave unlimited chances to link account and get giga points im so disappointed with that I really need load for my online class and that's the way you can help other for their online class...

Im confused as to why the data intended for stories and gaming were not deducted but rather my most important SHAREABLE DATA. Without that specific data i can no longer make use or open Fb nor COD. whatashame!"
5,
5,
3,This App should let us open it while updating because there are times that i really need to view how many left to my Sharable data As if its like your trying to say that we should update the App before openning it.
1,it's annoying how it always force you to update the app. It wouldn't work if you won't update it.
4,
5,I gave 5 star cause first time it gaves me 100 mb and i updated the game it gaves me another 100 mb

4,"A very Good App with a promising future only if they fix some bugs regarding the difference or accurate data balance from app against data balance on Smart Text Notification when data remaining is only 50mb. Also Hope that we can enter the App and Register our favorite promo even without data balance, for the reason that the GigaLife App and dialing *123# all promos are not in sync that one has a promo that not available on the other one."

3,"I love this app because it's very convenient especially in checking your balance. However, I dislike the thing when I can't access the app because I have to update it first. How can I update it if I can't register to my desired promo or whatever? I hope you'll change this into just a notification and still allow the users to access the app even without updating it. It's very troublesome."

1,"Just purchased Giga 1Gb data w/1GB youtube story every day. While I was downloading youtube, Smart used up my 1GB data for surfing within the hour of subscription. It is meant for 3 days. But Smart took it instead of the free 1GB meant for youtube videos. Very disappointing! Regretted buying over P1,000 Smartload. Now I bought data from Globe so I can surf the internet bec Smart took 1GB meant for surfing instead of using the 1GB video everyday meant for youtube! Smart wasted my 1GB data!"

5,
5,"I love how it works. It helps me to monitor my usaged date and my balance without dialing *123# i can also monitor how many points i already have, you don't even needed a shareable data to open the app just open the data button and you can log in without a hassle and lastly i can easily register my giga promo in just 1 click❤️ looking forward for more updates. *I love your new update❤️"

1,"Nagupdate lang ang hirap na maglogin. Sabi mali daw na password nilagay ko tapos try ko palitan sabi ""You cannot put the same password"". So sabi ko odi tama pala ung password na nilagay ko nung una palang. Nilogin ko ulit tapos sinasabi parin na mali. Tapos pinalitan ko ulit ung password, tapos ang sabi naman ngayon ""Too many attempts please try again after 10 minutes"". NAPAKA BULOK!"
5,Very good

5,
1,"It is easy using this up by registering promos .. but what I hate,it needs always to update .."
5,Good apps
5,
5,
2,This is for prepaid. If you run out of data you can't open it to register any promo. You will consume a lot more or your cp will be useless.
5,
5,"It's really a good app. For start ups just don't forget to turn your data on before opening the app, and if you forgot to turn your data on before opening the app, close the app and turn your data on and open the again. And most importantly update the app everytime it says update it. Highly recommended for smart, tnt, and sun users. Easy to use and no hassle like going to phone and dialing *123# and pressing 1 2 3 4 5 6 and waiting for the loading time and connection failed."

But sometimes network delays between 7:00 pm to 11:00 pm I don't know why maybe there's a lot of user that time but I hope you fix it soon, and in every update I can't use my Giga App which is a hassle thing when my data runs out and I don't have a internet I'm not able to update and use it."

Dude I JUST NEED TO CHECK MY BALANCE AND HAVE TO RELOGIN AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE I CAN YOUUUYUUU SUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKK.

5,Nice app

1,Frequent updates make it worse! I don't have any extra Gb to download an update! I need to register first in order for me to download the update. Which makes this app useless.
5,

5,
5,
2,"I can't see what updates are needed, because everytime my load for data expires, the app says it gas to be updated and i cannot use it for registration. I used it once though, and was able to check my balance with few taps from the app."

When the registered load expires and I'm trying to renew it, the app doesn't allows me to use it as it requires DATA. Please bring back the old one when U can just enter this app and register load with ease without using the internet data. I literally waited for an hour, and forcefully use the old method of registering."

2,"The App keeps getting an update, I hope that you can make this App to Open even there's an update available, make it an optional. Edit: do u offer update free of charge? if yes, it's not working if you don't have data balance. It sucks, you need the App to register and monitor your load and yet it will not let you do so if there's an update available, the app won't open!"

I suggest also, that you include the pasaload and pasadata options in gigalife app in your next update so it will be easier for us to share load and data inside the app instead of sending sms via 808."

1,Sana mapansin niyo to. Sinusubukan kong magpasa data kaso ayaw na ngayon kahit na nagbalance ako at ang sabi may 900+ shareable data pero nung nagpapasa ako ayaw naman even na may regular load ako or kineme. Nakakadisappoint lang kasi need na need ng papasahan ko yung data kaso biglang ayaw. Bogus ba to? Nakakapagsend ako dati sa 0910 tapos ngayon ayaw na? Mga last week lang ata ako nakapag pasa sa 0910****+. :(
5,
3,"I like the it because it helps me to easily monitor and register. But, I do really hate thos everytime there's an update. It can't be open and I don't have enough data to update it."

5,very good
5,
1,
5,
5,
2,This is a good app for monitoring your usage and such but really hassle whenever there are new updates since you need to download the updated version first before you can open it; very inconvenient especially when you're in a hurry to register after your data expired. And they update from time to time which consumes my phone storage and time grRr

1,"It's great app because it's easier to register to my favorite GIGA promos but the downside is you need to update the app first to access it nd how can I update it when I'm registering to a data promo. So it'll cancel out the convenience and the use of it because I need to go dial #121# still to register which why I downloaded this app for. Please make it accessible even my app version is out of date and make it easier to exit because the app stil doesn't close when I press the ""Back"" button."
3,"I give 3 star on this, because app is all in good condition easier to register easy to manage the usage of data. But please make this app usable without data, i like to register in this app but you can't register if you dont have data or internet connection, its same as useless, this app is important to modem user that can easily registered if! It can use without data or internet connection."

But 4 stars only since the calls and texts promos were nowhere to be found on this app. Edit (12/5): The calls and texts promos are jow there. Hoping that they won't disappear again. Also, I would suggest to make the app less data consuming. Like we can open or access the app even if we don't have any data subscription yet. So how can we register to any promo if we opt to register it in the app?"

Now there's no option so that we can easily access the unli calls txt ml or fb..all you can see there is the P50 up unlis..pls dont be greedy and fix your connection. I edited my 5star rating..I love this before but now I really dont... I edited my review cause after the update the Other Promo icon is back..Thanks

5,
5,Awewsome
5,
5,
4,I like all the promos and how easy it works except that the promos does not include the videocall on the messenger. It consumes alot of data.
2,"Having trouble with the ""Home"" in this app. It keeps on loading. I can't even redeem gigapoints. I even update this app but no use. I even contacted the support but no respond. Please do something."

4,It is used to be good before but after the update I can't access my other account. Everytime I try to check the Data Usage of my other sim the app freeze and stop working. Please fix this. Edit : Thanks it worked but I hate the thought of uninstalling and reinstalling again its not convenient. That's why I will not give 5 star.

5,
5,New user here. This app has many features that can help people in the future. I'm looking on it.
1,your internet connection is the worst. You never fail to disappoint me. I can't enjoy the load that i'm paying. This app time and load consuming
5,
2,I don't even know what wrong with this app. I feel disappointed.😥 It started when I update the app. I can't check my data usage anymore.
5,Awesome!
4,"Okayyyy,it's fixed"
5,
5,
3,
5,
2,can even use my points nor register to the application to use my points 👎👎👎
1,Sayang yung nakukuhang points di man lang nagagamit sabayan pa na napakahirap mag sign in
3,Ok
5,
3,
2,Loads so slow. The only thing I use it for is for add ons since they disabled the text option which is easier. It does not make sense to need internet connection when you've used up your data so you can have additional data. The pldt app is better cause it shows how much data you have left.
1,
5,
1,"#143 is easier and it even gives complete info on GB, time, and load needed where gigalife just tells you it's name....and some random info you do not really need"
5,AMAZING
1,Pangit ng bagong UPDATE nag-ca-crush pagpuounta ka ng data usage di tuloy ma-monitor yong usage ko.
4,App is working properly now after the updates.. able to log in now.. thanks..

5,very satisfied
4,
5,
5,
5,
5,
3,I like the promo that exclusively in the app and the points that can be redeemed as a load but the big disappointment to me is the new updates that you need to have a internet connection before you can use the app. The early version is accessible even you don't have internet connection as long as the mobile data is on. I hope you bring this feature back because how we can register to the promo if we don't have internet specially to the data promo. I tried to restart too but still need internet
4,
4,
3,
5,
5,
5,I really liked the app. It's easy to use and very straightforward. But I wish to use it without internet promo since sometimes I ran out of data and I need to use the app to register but failed to do so because it needs internet connection to use.
1,
5,
5,
3,I hope in the next update we can ear points even 1.5points by buying 50 pesos load or subcribing to your promos. I can't afford 100 peso load because i didn't use my phone all the time.

5,It's a good app maybe if you can add more freebies😂
5,Can you please another section for promos other than GIGAs. It would be great to have it since it would lessen the hassle(like you know dialing *123# to check). Thanks🙏🙏🙏
5,Giga is perfect
5,
5,
5,
5,Nice
3,The app was good but update is annoying. I think it's better that the app can be updated after a couple of months or 3. I just updated last month and update again this month? Update is not free. Data charges applies though.
5,"Great..it's just, in order to continue using I have to keept it updated and it uses up MB's...🙁"

With this I'll be able to do so with ease. A downside of the app is that not all promos are available. I am still waiting for the unli-calls and texts with free 1 gb of data for videos and stories but still I am impress."

5,
5,
5,Good
5,
5,
5,
2,"You keep on updating, now even checking my balance/usage won't even show up in my screen and just turns into black. Aside from the fact that each time you update, it takes a quite amount of data when there's only minor changes you've done and the app now crushes, update is useless this time."

3,"It's a good app for usage checking but it's a great hassle for user who doesn't have data because you can not be accomodated., Moreover, it's always updating and if you don't have any data to update you will be left behind leaving the app useless or inaccessible.."
5,
5,I'll give 5 stars because it is less time consuming unlike before that we should dial *123# then choose what number. Now it's just 1 click away and we can easily check our usage. But sometimes it says it is under construction specifically on morning but i am really satisfied with the service
5,Nice. good. i like it and youll know it.

1,Forever under construction. 😂
4,Not all the promos are available on the app like Giga K-video and Giga Music. Maybe improve that because I can access all the promos just by dialling #123* so I honestly see no point for this app other than the freebies. If this app could include all features I can access by dialling #123* then I'll give this 5 stars.

3,I really enjoy your app it easy to use but I have some issue in your game promo Why don't have PUBGM and lite version Why giga games can't not use to different game can you added PUBGM lite and PUBGM LIKE GENSHIN OR CAN YOU CHANGE your promo plzz Giga games is all around games what I like to play becuz giga games is useless to different games I can't play my favorite game do you feel me Right now I'll gave you 5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ if you change your promo or added giga games pubgmlite
5,Happy
2,The free data given (gigamania) is useless since we need to use up the available data of our existing data subscription before we can use the said free data. It expires in three days.. useless

4,Very Good! But hope we can transfer load from within the App.
2,i hate it because you have to uptade it first if you dont uptade it it wont open what if i dont have sharable data anymore then i cant update I always using this to register til this update comes in so i cant register
4,"The service is okay. Can you add the promos that we can subscribe from *121# to this app so registering to that promos is convenient. Also the point system is somewhat unsatisfying. The promos available to claim is only limited to that high points required gifts. What if some redeemable gifts are claimable for low points required. Like, UTP 15 can be redeemable for 15 points also. Atleast more subscribers will gain interest in that points system. Thank you, hoping for further updates."

1,"I've tried to use your app for a day, and what I can say is, it was garbage. I've noticed that with the app installed, the app had tried to override the system 'data connection privilege' controls and updates it's values every single time a change happens in the app. What this means is that, your app would use shareable data even if you tried to block it from doing so. This is bullsh*t. I've never seen a third-party app bypass the system privileges before. This was a lot worse than I expected."

BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE LESS HASSLE!.

4,
5,good
5,
5,nice❤❤❤
4,
4,So far the GUI was easy and update of data should be more realtime and hope app can be opened with or less data to avail the promos. Promos must include shareable data only like 30gb for 1mos open access or 40gb for 1mos open access in reasonbale prices or at lower cost. Allow biometrics and facial recognition as log in options. Onscreen OTP much better than sending via sms. Data promos for pocket wifi / modem must be included in the app. 4 stars for now. Looking forward for next update.

4,
5,nice and good apps
4,I'm a bit confused as to which promo to choose since a lot of peomos have changed. Does Video promo mean the data can be used for anything or strictly video platforms like youtube? Can it support MS Teams or do you need the Work promo for that? App works great but maybe a slighty better description on the promos can help.

I registered giga games 1 and turns out it's 1gb free every day when the other times it was 2gb every day, it was because they put two same giga games 1 promo title but different types of freebies, it is not user friendly. I don't recommend this application not unless they will make it more use friendly."

3,"I use this app for my smart bro wifi, but sometimes I need to remove the simcard in order to subscribe a promo which is NOT present in Gigalife like Giga Work and Giga Study. I don't know but I think *123# is way more convenient than this app. Update: I already accessed the dashboard, but my point is Giga Work and Giga Study was not there. Only the Giga Work PRO and Giga Study PRO. The *123# has the Giga Work and Giga Study,"

1,"There is a charge for the use of this app when i am about to register a promo. As usual you need to switch the data connection for you to use it. Hope the developers would consider why we chose to switch on our data connections. Simply, make this changes as soon as possible for us to enjoy using this platform. Make no charges when we switch our data connection in order to register in a promo you will offer"
5,
5,"Give me free data or else, I'll uninstall this app😒"
5,
1,"SUPER SLOW AND BUGGY Not only when i login to claim my giga points because for some reason they didnt add it on their *123# menu, but this app is so slow that i cant even access it despite logging in. I waited 5 hours, and still nothing except the crappy loading background image. Please step it up, atleast in other networks you can actually claim rewards via sms and not require us to download an app. Pls refund my data i used to run your app for 5hrs trying to wait for it to load."

5,"Uhm, Great app for subscribing to Smart and tracking your subscription data."
1,"I just had to update this app. I tried to add load (i.e. 100 pesos) from my atm card and it keeps saying that I've exceeded the limit of my card but I still have some enough in my account. I'd change my mind about my review. Overall, i cant say that this app is nice."
4,
4,
5,Good
5,
4,It's ok.
1,They always say sorry for the inconvenience
1,Your available Add-ons are only 4 and does not suit my usage. My consumable plan is now useless for I need to pay more to use it. I have to pay an add on for data and a different add on for calls or text. Very inconvenient and not practical. 😕
3,I register to giga games 2 in this app but i don't receive the free code☹️
5,
1,Panay loading lang. Hindi maayos magamit kasi di naman lumalabas yung mga icon puro loading. Maayos naman yung net ko. Yung app lang hindi lol. Nagpapadami lang kayo ng numbers of downloads ng app niyo eh. Pakiayos naman po. Salamat.

5,
5,
1,If I could give zero stars! Your unli calls and texts have limits? Man! I registered 2 times on the promo but still it says not enough load balance! And you still decrease my load balance to zero when i make the call man! I was very upset by smart!
5,
4,Thats very nice
5,
4,
1,sobrang bagal ng loading. tapos ung account button hindi pa mabuksan. log out button lang pwd mong mapindot. grabe naman tong app na to. hindi ko mapakinabangan yung redeem. worst app. update nyo naman po.
1,
5,basta okay
4,
4,"I find this app very convenient and helpful, especially when you're checking the data usage of your registered promo. I think it would be better if you put some tool for sending a message or for offline use."
5,It feels comfortable to me using giga life
5,

5,Nice
5,
5,Pokining inam
5,This is a useful app because you won't have to dial the *123# to register a data plan and you can renew a data plan on this app in just 2 taps. Btw keep up the good work
5,
5,
5,Very awesome
4,
1,"why does my gigalifeapp keeps on deducting my shareable data when I'm not even using other apps, instead I'm using tiktok,fb,ig and twiiter. Instead of the Fb,Tiktok,IG,twitter stories should be the one deducting the shareable data is the obe being deducted? how come?"
5,
4,
3,The app was good in my experience it just slow for the loading time it would be great. I gave a 3 star review becoz of the point system not working I have been using the app before the point system Idk why I don't get the points and also the slow loading and the internet required for the app to function.
5,"For the recent update, GigaMania, my weekly raffle entry doesn't really record any entry that I've made so far I would just like to point that out and also with the log in, access is somewhat not usable during late hours of the day and sometimes it affects the speed of my data connection. And I would also like to know if there is a possible update in where you can set certain data cap for daily use as to prolong the data for those who uses it when connected to a laptop for example. Thank you"
4,Not soo good
4,
5,
5,🎂
5,
1,"I keep on updating the app because it always says ""Update now""."
5,"Sana yung zoom masama sa giga study na offer, madalas kasing zoom yung platform ng online class, tapos yun din isa sa malakas sa data. Yung load mo na pang 1 week 2 days na lang. Malaking tulong samin pag ganun sana maapprove."
3,This app isn't work.so don't install it.

4,
5,
3,
5,This is Great.. having so many freebies
3,"There were times that I cant access the app. After the splash screen it proceeds to a black screen. I tried to wait but nothings happen. Is it because of maintenance issue? Atleast put a notice/sign of maintenance on the screen and not just the black screen. I prefer more using the app than the usual *123# method. Overall, it is still a good app. Will re evaluate my ratings once this issue resolved."

1,"It was doing great on fooling people. You download it, it worked for 3 days and after that you cant monitor your data usage anymore. And you keep losing your data for i dont know reason. Cant wait for that 3rd telco... You will never see a single Filipino money if 3rd telco is up... That for sure."
1,It's a scam!!
5,
5,Easy and discount
2,"I just changed my phone UI into Korean and this app no longer works. ""Unparseable date: December 12, 2020 13:08"". Improve your programming of this app, Smart. How come this minor change makes your app unusable?"
5,
5,
5,
4,It is beneficial to use because it doubles up the promo but I don't like the continuous update because I don't have data to do it and I ended up registering through *123#. I suggest you notify beforehand when you plan to update or at least give free data enough to update the app
5,
2,crashes a lot and doesn't give enough fata as stated
1,

1,always asking for otp code to log in every time i use it
5,"I like how I can track how much more data I have which makes managing it a lot easier. The interface is clean and nit confusing. One thing I really don't like is the fact that every time I open the app, I have to log in with an OTP just to check my account. It's very annoying and inconvenient Edit: great! the thing with the OTP is finally gone"

5,
5,
1,"It keeps saying ""CHAIN VALIDATION FAILED"""
5,The app is good but please can you add the pasaload system because my sim recently been broken and i have a 110 balance in the sim but i can't use it because it's broken please immediately add that pasaload system if you can that's all

1,App doesn't load ...bring back the means to register to your promo using text msgs...i am using smart bro and the pocket wifi doesn't have a dial pad so i can't dial *123#...and this app doesn't load it's not useful. Ed. Ok so the immediate responses as how to try and address the issue is commendable at least even if the app doesn't seem to work...
5,5 stars ....but can you give free load for christmas hahhahaha
5,
1,giga points ilang araw lang ? wala na. walang kuwenta po promise
5,

5,
4,Good
1,What happened to this great app I just updated it but chain validation is popping up what's goin on 😡
2,"Why does its always needs to be updated? Like since i downloaded this app, i already had 3 updates and now i need to update again. The upsetting part is i'm only on data and i cant view the app if i won't update first 😫"

How do I solve this issue?"
3,It's hard to use the app. I already registered in gigamania but still my raffle entries was still 0. What should I do?

3,"Doesn't make sense, you have to update the app for nothing, marketing strategy huh, and its not available offline, how can it be helpful if its not available in offline, how can we avail the promos we wanted that's not in the dial mode, user inteface is good, features is good also.... Ill change it soon if you make changes also :)"
3,
1,"""Under construction"" for so long"

5,Usable
5,Best
4,Ok
5,
5,Nice and usable apps with freebies and more exciting rewards and prizes waiting
4,"A bit redundant considering there's mysmart. But this is a good step in the right direction for smart. Please work on the loading times of usage and also REMOVE THE VIBRATION when swiping to another account. Who needs that haptic feedback when you choose another number? So far this is also more rewarding than the mvp rewards that you put in place for the old rewards system. Payment of bills on time should always be rewarded to encourage brand loyalty. Likewise, please make sure you maintain it."

2,"Only 2stars for now as i have tried and failed a gazillion times with the sign up process. Tried all combos for ""stronger password"" and still the same. And this was after i just updated the app. What a waste of time. All this just so i can redeem my gigapoints, i'll change the rating as soon as i see the issue fixed. PS I know what you meant by mix characters and i did all that what you're suggesting and nope,none's accepted. Now,there's another update with the app we'll see if its any better."

5,Good
1,"Makakatulog ka sa bagal mag load ng home screen! Update: After waiting 10 minutes, I uninstalled the app."
2,The Gigalife update with gigamania is so broken. I can't view the gigamania page coz when you open it it becomes a black screen. Yes I've already uninstalled and reinstalled the app 2 times. And Yes my Smart sim is in tray 1. They should just make the app lighter with no blings and animations. Usability is better than vanity. 😒
3,Nice
5,
5,
5,Nice and good
1,"After subscribing to a promo for 7 days I just used it for two days and when I used my extra 2gb of my promo and the daily 2gb was being wasted daily. After 2 days of not connecting, I can used it now but how about the 2 days that was wasted?"

It always shows 'Something went wrong, please try again' even though I'm endlessly refreshing it. If this won't be fixed, it's probably better to uninstall. Re-rated. Everything is back to normal. Hate to go all this mess. Edit: resolved and looking good so far. 👌"

1,"To be honest, since I updated mine the app is no longer useful. You cannot use it because it keeps on loading. The GigaLife green background will appear shortly. However, instead of popping up features, it will remain in black background which one assumes it doesn't load at all. Bring back the old app. We don't need a poor service from Smart!!!"

1,You have the worst signal ever. You keep on creating apps like this but it cannot hide nor solve you're inconsistent and pretty much horrible data speed and data bundle promos. Why do you have to limit the sites where additional data are used? You can just create a promo of 10 gb for a week for the same price and that would be so much better.
5,I really love to use this app because I can easily look for my data usage.

Nung ginamit ko to para magsubscribe sa Giga K-Video, hindi gumagana yung Viu Premium kahit may confirmation na thru text messages na successfully subcribed na ako. Kahit yung TNTph nagmessage na ako, di pa rin nila nagawan ng paraan. Ang pangit lang nakakairita."

1,"The app works fine with the 'Quick View' base functionality but the once I log-in it just gives me a black screen, becomes unresponsive and slows down my phone. Update: My Smart sim is in slot 1. I've tried reinstalling multiple times already but that didn't fix the problem. I've even tried disabling the 2nd sim slot but that did nothing either. I think there are some compatibility issues brought forth by the Gigamania update. Or it's just completely incompatible with my HTC U11 (Android 9)."

About redeeming giga points while currently subscribed to other subscription (my own experience) I'm currently subscribed to GigaGames100 when I used my giga points to redeem GigaVideo50 two days before the expiration of my GGames100.

1,Only loading
2,"I worried that my account details would be compromised resulting in misused transaction when linked with another account user. I know it sounds dumb to share the OTP with other users but this feature is an avenue to unauthorozed access just because a mobile number is linked to someone's Gigalife account. Though, I trust to share my account information to a family member but this is really unsecure... you can just register a promo on someone's mobile number without further authentication."
5,
5,

1,"Always havinh update, so annoying. Right when you need to register to a promo, you need to update first."
5,I like the promos and raffle draw olus the points that I can get whenever I use it to load.
1,It doesn't work. Why? I think this app does not consider old sim card. I tried the new sim that i bought and it works while in my original one it does not. So this app is freaking bias.
1,"i installed this app right now but, its not working."
5,Useful

Even in social media platforms, just advertising no improving quality at all. Communicate with integrity to your customers who consume your services.

Even if I can copy/paste the number, I still have to delete the first 2 digits of my number, otherwise, the last two digits will be truncated and the ""09"" will be duplicated.

1,This app has been crashing on Oppo A3s and because of that I have uninstalled it but I already registered it to be able to join raffle draw. Please fix the problem that not because we happen to uninstall the app and reinstall again giga points will not reflect on raffle draw. It is so unfair to our part to not be able to participate in raffle draw while our points is just sitting there. Please do something bout it. Thank you so much

4,
5,Working perfectly fine now. I love the weekly freebies
3,
1,I regularly check this app for my data balance. My cutoff is every 15th of the month and I still have 230mb as of the 15th. When I got my bill P200.70 charge from over use of data from 12/7-12/15. Impossible. So this app is either inaacurate or a SCAM. CS was accommodating but no resolution given. CS said no way to check previous months usage to check if there was data that expired. SUP is unhelpful. Got this postpaid for years. But no thank you. Goodbye SMART. Closing acct after holidays.

3,"Tip for new users: Logout then use ""Quick view"" instead. Smart, your app is buggy. I tried restarting my phone, reinstalling, etc. Such a hassle to use an app. I will not exert more effort to fix this. I also don't like how I was forced to use this app instead of being able to sign up for packages via text. Poor user experience. Edit: it eventually worked."

3,The app was easy to use and the freebies are amazing but my problem is that it said that the app doesn't take any data in your mobile data but looking at the data usage I actually takes data and for some reason takes sharable data even though the app I was using is in the promo that gives you 1gb per day also the data usage stat in the app isn't updated in real time unlike the built in data usage ranking in most phones these days.
5,Excellent!

Edit: i already messaged your facebook page, i thought everything was ok but now it's back to consuming my shareable mb again when I still have 300+mb left on that freebie. it's like you only solved the problem so that you won't lose a customer and then suddenly went back to ur old system letting me think that u solved everything when clearly u didnt. UPGRADE ur network's system just like how TNT did"

2,I have tried the promo on giga life and purchase video+allnet.. It didn't process but they deducted the amount on my account.. I just wasted my money.. The application is worthless..
2,"Thus app hangs and leaves you a blank black screen and then notifies you that the app will need to be closed. NOT A FRIENDLY FUNCTIONING APP!! So I have done that, uninstalling and re installing the app, then restarting my phone, actually 2 phones probably around three times, and this app still leaves me a blank screen. I uninstalled 5 other apps to make room, I thought I even religiously cleared all other apps'cache to no avail. Please get this app to work!! P.S. I don't have dual SIM phone"
3,"I love the freebies but when i installed this app the warning about my promo is not texting anymore. For example when my video everyday is now 50mb left it is texting me that my VEveryday is 50 mb left, but when i installed this app its not warning me anymore. How do i fix this?"
5,I'm sariesfide gigalife I loved it
3,Honestly I uninstalled this app mutiple times because i thought that with this app my data got worsen and the signal is also become so slow and its frustrating but then I do download it again uhm after knowing that's not the reason of having poor connection.

5,
1,"Hindi ka makasign up. Then yun account balance, hindi updated. Useless"
4,"The reason why I only gave it a 4 star is, when subscribing to other promos like giga stories and giga games, there are no giga points will add. Giga points will only get if you subscribe in giga video promos. I hope this concern will be notice and help this app to improved."
3,Good apps

I hate it when they entice you with a promo but they won't let you avail it. scam! It's still the same after doing what they suggested. UPDATE: one of THE WORST APPS Re-installed the app and still it's not working. Can't log in and register for promos, smart should fire these worthless developers."
3,"it was fine a few days ago.. but it always says ""Were not able to process your request right now. Please try again later."" Also Why can't you offer other games like Rockman X Dive, Gundam Battle Gunpla Warfare or Marvel Future Fight like the games your offering. I've already spent like 3 subscription of 99php with 2gb all sites and 1gb for YouTube.. Can't you do something about this? I am spending more without getting the satisfaction I want. I am a long term customer and I always pay ontime"

1,"While the Giga App has been very useful for checking/renewing my data status and managing/paying my Smart Bro bill, lately it hasn't been loading my data and it keeps telling me to try again later. I've already tried using my Wi-Fi and data, as well as uninstall and re-install the app to no avail. I hope your team can fix the issue very soon since it's a pretty useful app for Smart/TnT subscribers. You'll get a higher rating from me once you're able to address this on your end."

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but same issue happen. I hope smart fix this because honestly the app is quite easy to navigate and it's faster to register than dialing *121#.

1,"The old My Smart app better. This app doesn't show expiry of promo & doesn't allow you to add multiple accounts. Not all available Smart promo are indicated, only Giga promos. I think this app made specifically for Giga subscribers only Also, PLDT accounts cannot be registered. If so, how can PLDT wifi users register their accounts & take advantage of its features? Will just update my rating when the app improves because it may take months or even more than a year before a major update comes"

And that platform us equally tedious to navigate. Why in the world would you switch from a one-tap app to something with a gazillion options that do nothing. When everyone else is developing software to make evrything easier, you're doing the exact opposite. Makes no sense at all!"

3,"Hopefully you will also include a feature that tracks a smart/tnt subscriber's mobile data usage per hour for the past 1 day or so. Kinda like a line graph or something, so that he/she will be aware on what time did he consumes data the most. Cuz right now, the app only shows the current mobile data that i have whenever i used your app in that current moment."

1,"The old Smart app is better coz I just need my PW to login & I see all my Smart/TNT SIMs, (including my family's & load all sims). Why OTP to login everytime? Just to load same SIM on same fone? Very irritating and disappointing in my area where Smart has very limited to no signal. Im, more or less, 1 km away from a Smart cell tower. Smart signal was better then when we moved to this area in 2013. I can receive/make calls while Im in bed. Now Im signal searching in the streets. DISGUSTING"

5,its a great connections
3,It's a good app if you're trying to avail Smart's new promos but in general the older MySmart app is already good but they just left it in oblivion instead of having it updated with newer features & promos that we can actually use. Smart is BETTER in network quality if I were to choose between it and Globe but their main point of weakness is that their promos are so from 2 yrs ago especially data where they could've given us 5GB all access data + Unli AnyNet SMS for ₱50 which Globe does already.

Nung unang nag-register ako ng 50php load ko gamit ang apps na 'to, ang sabi do'n sa msg, 10 php bal daw ang balik load, nang tingnan ko, 5 php lang. Naghintay ako ng ilang araw, baka na-traffic lang, pero wala talaga. Nung sumunod na linggo naman, nag-register ulit ako ng ng 99php load, ang sabi ulit sa dumating na msg, ang balik load daw 20 php, nang tingnan ko, 10 php lang. Ano ba talaga? BUG BA 'TO?"
5,Looks good
1,"Useless app. And also, shout out sa Smart Network grabe ni wala pa ko in open ibang apps maliban sa messenger ko na my free 1gb , nalingat lang ako 50mb nalang natira sa data ko. Wow na wow talaga. Hiyang hiya naman ang mga Pilipino sainyo mahirap na nga mas pinahirap nio pa."
5,
5,Good

2,New update sucks!! you can't even open the app!!
1,Poor and connecting
5,
1,
1,
5,
1,"The new update doesn't work. It just says that there's a problem. I hope you add the option to subscribe to other promos found on *123#, not just giga promos. And I also hope that you'll add an auto-renew or something where the user can schedule a promo subscription which the user will pay on or before the promo is automatically subscribed"
4,
1,"The latest updates sucks, where are the promos/offers icons? Everytime i refresh, a message 'something went wong, please try again' appears. I cant view and check my data usage. Hope you can fix this as soon as possible."

I can't even view text message because there is no app to sync smartbro pocket wifi and the text messages on it.

2,"My Smart app is better than this app because I can see all my accounts there. This app needs an OTP that means you can only see the details of the SIM inserted on the phone you are using. For now, I'm sticking to mySmart app."
1,Sa internet wala kayong kwenta pati sa app wala padin kayong kwenta. Mga ganid sa pera pota nyo. Magnanakaw pa ng load ampotah in-open ko lang yung app para mag pa register kinain pa load ko. Mga patay gutom sa pera! ./.

5,
5,
1,i thinks if promos say play online.. make it all of play online games...
1,Could be better. Not satisfy with the interface. With the way it works and with smart whose not offering fare plans. No freebies. Nothing. you got1gb for 50pe and unlimited text yes but compare to other company we got 2gb unlimited text and freebies. And it's stay for the 3 days l. But smart I can't understand how fast those data goes for 3 days can't even stay for 3 hours. To be honest I love smart fast Ethernet. Good service yes they got a lot of good things. But why not offer more.......
5,
1,Useless. did you check the roots of this app before you launch it? What kind of developer you have. I un installed it.its a junk. Pls get back the prev version. Canceled or remove the update. Much better

1,After the update the app seems to be not working at all. This is so inconvenient. I downloaded the app for convenience but it has given me nothing but headache. Wasted my data allowancw just by downloading it.
4,
5,
1,After the latest update. It kept on saying I don't have remaining balance left as well as current promo subscription which I have at the moment.
5,

5,
5,
4,
1,Updated the app but still not helpful. Like when I want know how much balance I still have on my 1GB for the day is left. Nada it doesn't show so it is useless it just the same as on *123#. So disappointed as there was no improvement on the app. I still have to guess how much data I still have.i updated this app again and it has become useless will not even show the amount of my balance unlike before. Totally useless and waste of time.
1,I cannot access the status of my simcard since the latest update zzzzz
4,

5,
1,After I update the app cannot be open.
1,"Terrible, the update of this app is a ""must"" which is annoying because how can we update it when we can't register to any promo because the app isn't working and needed to be updated. And secondly, after the update the app become worst, we can't register to any promo and won't detect our load balance. The app promised that the newer version would be better but how in the hell that supposed to happen. Fix this app."
5,very useful😍

1,"Very disappointing. I subcribe on 50 for 3days with 2gb data allocation for ig, fb, tiktok etc. Im confidently using fb since it has 2gb allocation but when i cheked my 1gb consumable data is used up while the 2gb allocation for fb has barely mb used. It disappoints me badly now i can't play or search anything on the bcoz the mb left is for fb etc. I have to register again for me to do what i want on the web."
5,fine
1,"Since the update, we can't see the time when the 1GB video everyday will refresh. whh did u guys remove it? add it in the app again."

1,Hi smart i would like to know what is happening to when i use pasaload to my friend it supposed to be 2pesos charges right? Then why it change me always 52pesos for 30pesos only pasaload? Pls explain i need answer!
3,I really shouldn't have to key in my mobile number everytime I launch the app. It should at least have it pre-populated once it's verified.
5,
5,
5,
5,Ok
5,
2,
1,there's really nothing that you can do with the app instead of reloading that we can easily do with the *123#. Globe's GCash has a lot better feature that this. What a waste of space.
5,
4,
5,thank you
5,The app is very helpful. I can see my balance and subscriptions even if I'm using a number that's on a different device and I find it very handy because of that.
1,
4,Mas ok kung more than 1 number ang mare-register
5,
5,

1,
5,App no longer works after the update. UPDATE: Now working. Thanks
3,I think it would be better to retain the previous design... it is more understandable on how many days left your promo is.... not just the exact date of promo expiration...
5,👍
5,
5,
5,Nice
5,
5,
5,Very nice
5,I Love The App It's Easy To Subscribe The Promo & Load But I Wish You Can Access Sun Cellular Are Accepted Because Only Smart & TNT Sims Can Access This App Next Update I Wish You Have Sun Cellular Are Now Accepted To Make Easy Too Subscribe In Promo & Load 5 Star For Smart App

4,
4,"I use this app most of the time because I find it hassle to dial *123#, I love how it now allows you to reload online and shows the current transactions and their expiry.. 👍"

3,"Pangit ng update. Mas organisado and mas magandang tingnan yung layout ng old na version (specially dun sa graphical representation ng usage). Though maganda yung renew button pero pangit yung positioning kase mapipindot at mapipindot mo yun kung multitasker ka at naka on yung all screen ng phone. Pala, sometimes hindi nag uupdate yung stats kahit nakafullbar na 4g yung signal."

5,ty for more internet and more promo
5,It easy to use and everytime I register my fav promo it has ₱10 back load.
5,good
3,"App seems to improve, but still far from fixed. For example, multiple subscriptions (ex. subscribing to GIGA STORIES whilst subscribed to GIGA VIDEO) are not possible. (Original review: Completely broken after an update. Only the load balance is visible, nothing else, not even subscriptions.)"
5,
5,
5,
1,"I have to log in again after I exited the app. Is that how it works? If that's it, this sucks."

1,Do not update this because I don't have space
5,
5,
4,"Its great even before the update. I dont know why its crashing for others. Although I prefer the layout of the check usage part before the update. And also if there'll be another update, is it possible to view the exact data of the surfmax promo? Its better to know if how much you've consumed unlike the text message saying you've already consumed 640mb or such. Thank you so much!"
2,Why do i have to enter my phone no. Everytime i use this app?. Can we just do it once

1,Include corporate accounts so we can also see our data usage. Edit to reply to Dev Tian: That app also does not support corporate accounts. Only retail postpaid accounts are supported there. Please don't exclude corporate accounts because we are also paying customers and we deserve transparency on services used. Thanks.

1,Stop making false advertisements. Fix your services especially in this pandemic wherein teachers and students needs stable internet connection. You have a pricey promos while your services is poor. We do not have choice because both You and Globe has a poor services. You and Globe are not ashamed on what Jack Ma said about your services.

5,
5,Accurate
5,

5,i can now watch freely to my favorite social media app.
3,Should have an option to share a load. I don't see one.
2,It's a great app especially when you are registering your load for cashbacks but the bigger problem is it doesn't open until you have to update it. You can't even get the 20% cash back load without opening the smart app.
4,nice
4,Not perfect but a very useful app for a smart user like me. Keep up the good work and hoping for you guys to improve this app.
1,I was having issues availing promo from the pldtsmart app then i was told by cs rep to use this app and it was terrible. The previous promo famload were not even available so I had no choice but to choose whatever is there but it would even allow me avail anything.
5,Condusive and economical
5,sarified

4,I hope smart/tnt/sun also give rewards for every purchase of load so that users can enjoy loading and having freebies just like glove 😁 I give 4stars for a fast network sometimes
5,
4,Balik load is taking so long -_-
1,The app always updates. I couldn't able to open it unless I update. I just update the app then it is asking me to update it again. It's kinda annoying.

1,"1 gb in this time of crisis and stay home orders is nothing worth close for 99 pesos, 1 gb for 7 days is a cheesy 150 mb per day, pure rip off compared to other countries. And your 1gb YouTube is good to watch 0.8 movies. At least you should built a safe in that prevents consuming shareable data once 1 gb YouTube is used. A full movie cost the daily YouTube plus half of the data."
5,
5,
5,
3,"Sana sa Giga 99 promo nyu, na carry over sa next day yung free 1gb video, especially sa hindi nagamit... Like sa globe.. Almost same lang kayu ng promo nila mahina lang globe dito sa lugar namin.. Coz if not i will go w/ them kasi maganda offer... Sorry for comparing Peru dapat may ganun din kayu na e offer sa mga customer.. Just like.me, coz i.have the impression na ganun ang mangyayari kaya hindi ko pinapaabot na ma expire load ko, but i found out di pala.. So useless pala..."
4,"Well, it is great but instead of entering just one mobile number at a time just to view the status of promos, I recommend the option to add all active prepaid accounts for the convenience of just one OTP"
5,ok
5,
5,Ok satisfied

5,"Before the update, the app was working fine, but I had to update it or else I won't be able to use it, which is definitely annoying, so I decided to update it and now, I can't use it everytime I try to it only says something went wrong but my data is totally fine.. Like seriously!!!! Please fix this"

4,"Im pretty satisfied with the internet speed, but I have a question, does giga games apply to all games or only for Mobile Legends, COC, AOV, and Clash Royale? I tried to play a different game ( skullgirls mobile) but I can't connect."

5,
5,"There's a major flaw within the app after it's latest update 6/23/2020. First of all, it tells me i have zero balance left (despite currently having a few pesos left). When I try to refresh it, it always says something went wrong in spite of having turned on the data connection. Secondly, I can no longer see how much MB I have left forcing me to manually check it through *121# on the phone. Hoping for your swift restoration on this situation. Overall the app is really satisfactory. Edit: Thanks"
1,Can't register any promo. The app crashes every time I try to register a promo.
5,Super GIGA!

4,very usefull! I just don't like the interface
5,Amaaaze!
5,Great app!! Easy to navigate!
5,"Kind of cool, but i hope there's benefit installing this (like free net, txt or load etc.) for now, 5 stars bcuz it serves its purpose well (checking ballance)"
2,Smart prepaid user here but I cannot proceed with my mobile number.
3,"I think this app is ok and the purpose of the app to suggest different promo is good, however you should have like rebate for the user's to use the app more often or some kind of promos for those smart users that installed the app."
3,Its ok to check balance need way more details about the promos look foward to updates
5,Cool. Less complications..
5,this is better than manually checking data through text. i hoped i get offered a phone plan after installing the beta app :)
4,"What if we don't have data subscription, expired subscription and offline? Is this still available on offline mode?"
5,Great start..the app looks great polished y simple to use...and has information the user requires instantly...Keep up the good work..A foreigner...
3,"Promos should be descripted. It should show to us what can we get in the package. Also one thing that could really be useful, Make.It.Also.Usable.Offline."
4,Describe your promos and make it usable even without data access
5,Awesome app and thanks for this very convenient application 😍
3,
5,Ok
5,
5,So very nice that have now app for easy register my load to your promotion thank you so much
4,"Considering that it is just new, Im giving a 4 star because of the easier way to register some of the hot promos and checking balance and data usage/sms/call Hope to see more promos added 👍"
5,
5,Nice apps
1,"another un useful app, why don't you guys just develop your existing myPLDTSmart apps before developing another useless app"
3,Asside from data usage hope like pldt you also include tha date time of expiry
5,
4,Nice App!! it's Extremely Usefull For Me
2,Great app maybe improve data speed
5,Thank you. For this information
5,
3,The app does not allow registration of multiple Smart numbers / accounts. I need to log in every time for both Smart and Smartbro LTE numbers.
5,
5,"The app is easy to use and i share the same sentiments with the others about the promotions and rewards. Lastly, it would be really amazing if registering to giga99 will include free texts for it would be of great help to us subscribers. Thank you!"
5,Hopefully meron siyang notification every hour or optional to know ilang MB na yung na consume mo. Para di na yung panay open sa apps. So far very nice tong apps. Keep it!
4,"great app! lightweight, easy to use, it gives the user simple info about their current regular balance and details of your remaining data subscription including regular data, YouTube, games and other apps, i hope it can be use offline and please dont add Ads. thanks! congrats!"
5,
1,It doesnt work like your other apps. Nice. More spam apps to come!!!
1,It doesnt work at all
3,
5,
1,
2,
3,"I like the revamp UI, but in terms of usability.. Why would you put your promos first rather than the actual or current promo usage? People using prepaid promos should see their existing usages first before the promos. Maybe add some survey inside the app so you can identify the usability of your app from the users."
5,Amazing
5,Good
5,
5,
3,
1,"I'm a Smart Prepaid user still, I cannot register my sim on the app. It says something like, ""Coming Soon. Only available for smart users"" I've emailed you, and you have no response about that."
1,Cant get my smart bro prepaid balance
4,OTP code is already working thats why i change my rating .. The app is good but still need more improvements ..
5,
5,
5,Good
5,
3,Is this intended to replace the My Smart app?
3,I just tried it an its working but i hope they will also put information about your datas not only your load balance such as if you have subcription or any remaining data once you open the app and type in your number.
1,Expired token - only available for prepaid users. I'm using a prepaid sim. Could not connect. Absolutely useless.
5,Please check my subscriptions I just load gigavideo99 the other day and I haven't receive my 1G everyday as stated in my subscription. This is so disappointing. This is the second time already please do something about it. Where can I call?
5,
5,
5,The best the smart so please update my data please fix the android system the unit unit 1907
4,"Recommending the following: 1) Chart summary of data usage so you may visually trend the usage let's say daily. Currently, only the 'as of' balance is shown. 2) Expiration date & time of current subscription is shown (similar to *123# bal info). This is important so users would know when exactly to subscribe again. Currently only remaining DAYS is shown. 3) Usage button or information should be at the top portion (probably beside the regular load balance) and not at the promos section."
5,
4,
5,Now i'll tri it

4,"Always dont find my passwords during I'm open my google , fb, msngr etc. Im always loading prepaid to avail in every promo of smart , sun , globe, smart broadband.. etc. Im the only user of my gadget. Dont make speculations that I'm not me here in all my accounts"
3,
1,"this is the third app of this company, all with the same function. how many times do i need to download your apps?"
4,
5,

1,"Im having error when trying to put my phone number ""URI request is invalid or the resource request does not exist"" this happen just after i update to the newest version. Restart and Reopen App: Done Clear catch : Done Uninstall and reinstall : Done Mobile data status: 4G Hope this could be fix"
5,
5,Great
4,This app is user friendly. Execllent for monitering daily usage. Better than *123#

2,Always need for OTP everytime you need to check your balance. No multiple account enrollment.
5,Good
5,
4,"The app is good so far. It'll be better if it shows different offers not just GIGA promos. Overall, the app is working fine."
5,
4,
4,
5,
4,The app would be nicer if you didn't need to login again and again. Just put an option to logout or change number. Or added security would be great if your auto logged in. But overall it's a very good app.
5,
1,There is no option to view multiple account even if we already registered 2 number in 1login accounts. please update. I would rather choose the old app or login on the web instead.
3,
5,
1,Ang tagal mag open
3,
5,
1,After I installed the app my phone was freezing and it is not responding.

5,
5,
1,"This app is really really really bad. When i first open it, it says ""make sure you're smart sim is in sim 1 and mobile data is turned on"". So and i need to transfer my smartsim to sim 1. I will not because my messages is in sim 1. And 1 things is that i can't log in to my smart number it says ""Brand series is not found or not available""...! I want also to use this app because I'm a smart user. But sadly this app doesn't work properly."

2,Could've integrated the new features on the old app which is much informative compared to this one. Sure this is easy to use but the other one is better. Seems like a waste of digital space
1,It did do what it's supposed to do reading you data usage and how much is left like my shareable mb but does tell me back on youtube shareable it's said 1gb what time i play youtube videos it does not show the true details on how much it's left!

5,
1,"Re: I am on a wifi network. The best way to protect our number from hacker is to enhance your security policy. You can add an extra layer of security rather than always asking to input our mobile number and OTP. It's annoying. (1) Every time I open the app, it always ask to enter my mobile number and OTP. What does OTP mean to you ha? Diba One-Time-PIN yon? Eh bakit palagi hinihingi? Bulok. Uninstall na nga."
1,it says in your message that i will get free 1gb so i download it but the free 1gb for video is just a click bait i cant even log in my acc if is not in sim 1 so i didnt use it and uninstall it
5,I'm so speechless about this app because of its contribution to me as a person
5,very good like it very much... keep it up
1,"Keep saying ""the brand series is not found or not available"" and I even know what it means."

1,Updated and now I can't access it. It says it is only for prepaid consumers when in fact I'm using a prepaid sim.
4,Been using this app for quite a long time now. Everything's working fine until I updated the app a while ago. I'm using smart prepaid and the app's prompting me that this app is only for smart prepaid users for now; which I am but I can't sign in. Pls fix this.

1,Bwisit ito. Crashing after update. Sayang lang pinang update ko kay mahal mahal na nga data niyo. Alisin niyo na sa playstore itong app. Mag Globe nalang ako.
